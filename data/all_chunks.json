In both senses, the term\nrefers to some form of explanatory reasoning. However, in the\nhistorically first sense, it refers to the place of explanatory\nreasoning in generating hypotheses, while in the sense in\nwhich it is used most frequently in the modern literature it refers to\nthe place of explanatory reasoning in justifying hypotheses.\nIn the latter sense, abduction is also often called \u201cInference\nto the Best Explanation.\u201d \nThis entry is exclusively concerned with abduction in the modern\nsense, although there is a supplement on abduction in the historical\nsense, which had its origin in the work of Charles Sanders\nPeirce\u2014see the \nSee also the entry on\n scientific discovery,\n in particular the section on discovery as abduction. \nMost philosophers agree that abduction (in the sense of Inference to\nthe Best Explanation) is a type of inference that is frequently\nemployed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientific\nreasoning. However, the exact form as well as the normative status of\nabduction are still matters of controversy. This entry contrasts\nabduction with other types of inference; points at prominent uses of\nit, both in and outside philosophy; considers various more or less\nprecise statements of it; discusses its normative status; and\nhighlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesian\nconfirmation theory. \nYou happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row\nthat ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw\nTim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you\ncan think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends\nagain. \nOne morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the\ntable, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a\njar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude\nthat one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a\nmidnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think,\nbest explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that\nsomeone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on\nthe job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table\nwithout having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that\nsomeone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as\nproviding much more contrived explanations of the data than the one\nyou infer to. \nWalking along the beach, you see what looks like a picture of Winston\nChurchill in the sand. It could be that, as in the opening pages of\nHilary Putnam\u2019s book Reason, Truth, and History,\n(1981), what you see is actually the trace of an ant crawling on the\nbeach. The much simpler, and therefore (you think) much better,\nexplanation is that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill\nin the sand. That, in any case, is what you come away believing. \nIn these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the\npremises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and\nHarry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row\nwhich ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging\ntogether; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the\ninformation you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful\nstatistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that\nmight warrant an inference from the information that you have about\nTim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even\nto the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they\nare friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what\naccording to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant\nthis conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry\u2019s\nbeing friends again would, if true, best explain the\nfact that they have just been seen jogging together. (The proviso that\na hypothesis be true if it is to explain anything is taken as read\nfrom here on.) Similar remarks apply to the other two examples. The\ntype of inference exhibited here is called abduction or,\nsomewhat more commonly nowadays, Inference to the Best\nExplanation. \nPrecise statements of what abduction amounts to are rare in the\nliterature on abduction. (Peirce did propose an at least fairly\nprecise statement; but, as explained in the supplement to this entry,\nit does not capture what most nowadays understand by abduction.) Its\ncore idea is often said to be that explanatory considerations have\nconfirmation-theoretic import, or that explanatory success is a (not\nnecessarily unfailing) mark of truth. Clearly, however, these\nformulations are slogans at best, and it takes little effort to see\nthat they can be cashed out in a great variety of prima facie\nplausible ways. Here we will consider a number of such possible\nexplications, starting with what one might term the \u201ctextbook\nversion of abduction,\u201d which, as will be seen, is manifestly\ndefective, and then going on to consider various possible refinements\nof it. What those versions have in\ncommon\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014is that they are all inference\nrules, requiring premises encompassing explanatory considerations and\nyielding a conclusion that makes some statement about the truth of a\nhypothesis. The differences concern the premises that are required, or\nwhat exactly we are allowed to infer from them (or both). \nIn textbooks on epistemology or the philosophy of science, one often\nencounters something like the following as a formulation of\nabduction: \nAn observation that is frequently made about this rule, and that\npoints to a potential problem for it, is that it presupposes the\nnotions of candidate explanation and best explanation, neither of\nwhich has a straightforward interpretation. While some still hope that\nthe former can be spelled out in purely logical, or at least purely\nformal, terms, it is often said that the latter must appeal to the\nso-called theoretical virtues, like simplicity, generality, and\ncoherence with well-established theories; the best explanation would\nthen be the hypothesis which, on balance, does best with respect to\nthese virtues. (See, for instance, Thagard 1978 and McMullin 1996.)\nThe problem is that none of the said virtues is presently particularly\nwell understood. (Giere, in Callebaut (ed.) 1993 (232), even makes the\nradical claim that the theoretical virtues lack real content and play\nno more than a rhetorical role in science. In view of recent formal\nwork both on simplicity and on coherence\u2014for instance, Forster\nand Sober 1994, Li and Vitanyi 1997, and Sober 2015, on simplicity and\nBovens and Hartmann 2003 and Olsson 2005, on coherence\u2014the first\npart of this claim has become hard to maintain; also, Schupbach and\nSprenger (2011) present an account of explanatory goodness directly in\nprobabilistic terms. Psychological evidence casts doubt on the second\npart of the claim; see, for instance, Lombrozo 2007, on the role of\nsimplicity in people\u2019s assessments of explanatory goodness and\nKoslowski et al. 2008, on the role of coherence with\nbackground knowledge in those assessments.) \nFurthermore, many of those who think ABD1 is headed along the right\nlines believe that it is too strong. Some think that abduction\nwarrants an inference only to the probable truth of the best\nexplanation, others that it warrants an inference only to the\napproximate truth of the best explanation, and still others\nthat it warrants an inference only to the probable\napproximate truth. \nThe real problem with ABD1 runs deeper than this, however. Because\nabduction is ampliative\u2014as explained earlier\u2014it will not\nbe a sound rule of inference in the strict logical sense, however\nabduction is explicated exactly. It can still be reliable in\nthat it mostly leads to a true conclusion whenever the premises are\ntrue. An obvious necessary condition for ABD1 to be reliable in this\nsense is that, mostly, when it is true that H best\nexplains E, and E is true, then H is true as well\n(or H is approximately true, or probably true, or probably\napproximately true). But this would not be enough for ABD1 to\nbe reliable. For ABD1 takes as its premise only that some hypothesis\nis the best explanation of the evidence as compared to other\nhypotheses in a given set. Thus, if the rule is to be\nreliable, it must hold that, at least typically, the best explanation\nrelative to the set of hypotheses that we consider would also come out\nas being best in comparison with any other hypotheses that we might\nhave conceived (but for lack of time or ingenuity, or for some other\nreason, did not conceive). In other words, it must hold that at least\ntypically the absolutely best explanation of the evidence is\nto be found among the candidate explanations we have come up with, for\nelse ABD1 may well lead us to believe \u201cthe best of a bad\nlot\u201d (van Fraassen 1989, 143). \nHow reasonable is it to suppose that this extra requirement is usually\nfulfilled? Not at all, presumably. To believe otherwise, we must\nassume some sort of privilege on our part to the effect that when we\nconsider possible explanations of the data, we are somehow predisposed\nto hit, inter alia, upon the absolutely best explanation of those\ndata. After all, hardly ever will we have considered, or will it even\nbe possible to consider, all potential explanations. As van\nFraassen (1989, 144) points out, it is a priori rather\nimplausible to hold that we are thus privileged. \nIn response to this, one might argue that the challenge to show that\nthe best explanation is always or mostly among the hypotheses\nconsidered can be met without having to assume some form of privilege\n(see Schupbach 2014 for a different response, and see Dells\u00e9n\n2017 for discussion). For given the hypotheses we have managed to come\nup with, we can always generate a set of hypotheses which jointly\nexhaust logical space. Suppose\nH1,\u2026,Hn are the\ncandidate explanations we have so far been able to conceive. Then\nsimply define Hn+1 := \u00acH1\n\u2227 \u2026 \u2227 \u00acHn and add this new\nhypothesis as a further candidate explanation to the ones we already\nhave. Obviously, the set\n{H1,\u2026,Hn+1} is exhaustive,\nin that one of its elements must be true. Following this in itself\nsimple procedure would seem enough to make sure that we never miss out\non the absolutely best explanation. (See Lipton 1993, for a proposal\nalong these lines.) \nAlas, there is a catch. For even though there may be many hypotheses\nHj that imply Hn+1 and, had\nthey been formulated, would have been evaluated as being a better\nexplanation for the data than the best explanation among the candidate\nexplanations we started out with, Hn+1 itself will\nin general be hardly informative; in fact, in general it will not even\nbe clear what its empirical consequences are. Suppose, for instance,\nwe have as competing explanations Special Relativity Theory and\nLorentz\u2019s version of the \u00e6ther theory. Then, following the\nabove proposal, we may add to our candidate explanations that neither\nof these two theories is true. But surely this further hypothesis will\nbe ranked quite low qua explanation\u2014if it will be\nranked at all, which seems doubtful, given that it is wholly unclear\nwhat its empirical consequences are. This is not to say that the\nsuggested procedure may never work. The point is that in general it\nwill give little assurance that the best explanation is among the\ncandidate explanations we consider. \nA more promising response to the above \u201cargument of the bad\nlot\u201d begins with the observation that the argument capitalizes\non a peculiar asymmetry or incongruence in ABD1. The rule gives\nlicense to an absolute conclusion\u2014that a given hypothesis is\ntrue\u2014on the basis of a comparative premise, namely, that that\nparticular hypothesis is the best explanation of the evidence relative\nto the other hypotheses available (see Kuipers 2000, 171). This\nincongruence is not avoided by replacing \u201ctruth\u201d with\n\u201cprobable truth\u201d or \u201capproximate truth.\u201d In\norder to avoid it, one has two general options. \nThe first option is to modify the rule so as to have it require an\nabsolute premise. For instance, following Alan Musgrave (1988) or\nPeter Lipton (1993), one may require the hypothesis whose truth is\ninferred to be not only the best of the available potential\nexplanations, but also to be satisfactory (Musgrave) or\ngood enough (Lipton), yielding the following variant of\nABD1: \nNeedless to say, ABD2 needs supplementing by a criterion for the\nsatisfactoriness of explanations, or their being good enough, which,\nhowever, we are still lacking. \nSecondly, one can formulate a symmetric or congruous version of\nabduction by having it sanction, given a comparative premise, only a\ncomparative conclusion; this option, too, can in turn be realized in\nmore than one way. Here is one way to do it, which has been proposed\nand defended in the work of Theo Kuipers (e.g., Kuipers 1984, 1992,\n2000). \nClearly, ABD3 requires an account of closeness to the truth, but many\nsuch accounts are on offer today (see, e.g., Niiniluoto 1998). \nOne noteworthy feature of the congruous versions of abduction\nconsidered here is that they do not rely on the assumption of an\nimplausible privilege on the reasoner\u2019s part that, we saw, ABD1\nimplicitly relies on. Another is that if one can be certain that,\nhowever many candidate explanations for the data one may have missed,\nnone equals the best of those one has thought of, then the\ncongruous versions license exactly the same inference as ABD1 does\n(supposing that one would not be certain that no potential explanation\nis as good as the best explanation one has thought of if the latter is\nnot even satisfactory or sufficiently good). \nAs mentioned, there is widespread agreement that people frequently\nrely on abductive reasoning. Which of the above rules exactly\nis it that people rely on? Or might it be still some further rule that\nthey rely on? Or might they in some contexts rely on one version, and\nin others on another (Douven 2017, forthcoming)? Philosophical\nargumentation is unable to answer these questions. In recent years,\nexperimental psychologists have started paying attention to the role\nhumans give to explanatory considerations in reasoning. For instance,\nTania Lombrozo and Nicholas Gwynne (2014) report experiments showing\nthat how a property of a given class of things is explained\nto us\u2014whether mechanistically, by reference to parts and\nprocesses, or functionally, by reference to functions and\npurposes\u2014matters to how likely we are to generalise that\nproperty to other classes of things (see also Sloman 1994 and Williams\nand Lombrozo 2010). And Igor Douven and Jonah Schupbach (2015a),\n(2015b) present experimental evidence to the effect that\npeople\u2019s probability updates tend to be influenced by\nexplanatory considerations in ways that makes them deviate from\nstrictly Bayesian updates (see below). Douven (2016b) shows that, in\nthe aforementioned experiments, participants who gave more weight to\nexplanatory considerations tended to be more accurate, as determined\nin terms of a standard scoring rule. (See Lombrozo 2012 and 2016 for\nuseful overviews of recent experimental work relevant to explanation\nand inference.) Douven and Patricia Mirabile (2018) found some\nevidence indicating that people rely on something like ABD2, at least\nin some contexts, but for the most part, empirical work on the\nabove-mentioned questions is lacking. \nWith respect to the normative question of which of the previously\nstated rules we ought to rely on (if we ought to rely on any\nform of abduction), where philosophical argumentation should be able\nto help, the situation is hardly any better. In view of the argument\nof the bad lot, ABD1 does not look very good. Other arguments against\nabduction are claimed to be independent of the exact explication of\nthe rule; below, these arguments will be found wanting. On the other\nhand, arguments that have been given in favor of abduction\u2014some\nof which will also be discussed below\u2014do not discern between\nspecific versions. So, supposing people do indeed commonly rely on\nabduction, it must be considered an open question as to which\nversion(s) of abduction they rely on. Equally, supposing it is\nrational for people to rely on abduction, it must be considered an\nopen question as to which version, or perhaps versions, of abduction\nthey ought to, or are at least permitted to, rely on. \nEven if it is true that we routinely rely on abductive reasoning, it\nmay still be asked whether this practice is rational. For instance,\nexperimental studies have shown that when people are able to think of\nan explanation for some possible event, they tend to overestimate the\nlikelihood that this event will actually occur. (See Koehler 1991, for\na survey of some of these studies; see also Brem and Rips 2000.) More\ntelling still, Lombrozo (2007) shows that, in some situations, people\ntend to grossly overrate the probability of simpler explanations\ncompared to more complicated ones. Although these studies are not\ndirectly concerned with abduction in any of the forms discussed so\nfar, they nevertheless suggest that taking into account explanatory\nconsiderations in one\u2019s reasoning may not always be for the\nbetter. (It is to be noted that Lombrozo\u2019s experiments\nare directly concerned with some proposals that have been\nmade for explicating abduction in a Bayesian framework; see Section\n4.) However, the most pertinent remarks about the normative status of\nabduction are so far to be found in the philosophical literature. This\nsection discusses the main criticisms that have been levelled against\nabduction, as well as the strongest arguments that have been given in\nits defense. \nIn the past decade, Bayesian confirmation theory has firmly\nestablished itself as the dominant view on confirmation; currently one\ncannot very well discuss a confirmation-theoretic issue without making\nclear whether, and if so why, one\u2019s position on that issue\ndeviates from standard Bayesian thinking. Abduction, in whichever\nversion, assigns a confirmation-theoretic role to explanation:\nexplanatory considerations contribute to making some hypotheses more\ncredible, and others less so. By contrast, Bayesian confirmation\ntheory makes no reference at all to the concept of explanation. Does\nthis imply that abduction is at loggerheads with the prevailing\ndoctrine in confirmation theory? Several authors have recently argued\nthat not only is abduction compatible with Bayesianism, it is a\nmuch-needed supplement to it. The so far fullest defense of this view\nhas been given by Lipton (2004, Ch. 7); as he puts it, Bayesians\nshould also be \u201cexplanationists\u201d (his name for the\nadvocates of abduction). (For other defenses, see Okasha 2000, McGrew\n2003, Weisberg 2009, and Poston 2014, Ch. 7; for discussion, see Roche\nand Sober 2013, 2014, and McCain and Poston 2014.) \nThis requires some clarification. For what could it mean for a\nBayesian to be an explanationist? In order to apply Bayes\u2019 rule\nand determine the probability for H after learning E,\nthe Bayesian agent will have to determine the probability of H\nconditional on E. For that, he needs to assign unconditional\nprobabilities to H and E as well as a probability to\nE given H; the former two are mostly called \u201cprior\nprobabilities\u201d (or just \u201cpriors\u201d) of, respectively,\nH and E, the latter the \u201clikelihood\u201d of\nH on E. (This is the official Bayesian story. Not all of\nthose who sympathize with Bayesianism adhere to that story. For\ninstance, according to some it is more reasonable to think that\nconditional probabilities are basic and that we derive unconditional\nprobabilities from them; see H\u00e1jek 2003, and references\ntherein.) How is the Bayesian to determine these values? As is well\nknown, probability theory gives us more probabilities once we have\nsome; it does not give us probabilities from scratch. Of course, when\nH implies E or the negation of E, or when\nH is a statistical hypothesis that bestows a certain chance on\nE, then the likelihood follows \u201canalytically.\u201d\n(This claim assumes some version of Lewis\u2019 (1980) Principal\nPrinciple, and it is controversial whether or not this principle is\nanalytic; hence the scare quotes.) But this is not always the case,\nand even if it were, there would still be the question of how to\ndetermine the priors. This is where, according to Lipton, abduction\ncomes in. In his proposal, Bayesians ought to determine their prior\nprobabilities and, if applicable, likelihoods on the basis of\nexplanatory considerations. \nExactly how are explanatory considerations to guide one\u2019s choice\nof priors? The answer to this question is not as simple as one might\nat first think. Suppose you are considering what priors to assign to a\ncollection of rival hypotheses and you wish to follow Lipton\u2019s\nsuggestion. How are you to do this? An obvious\u2014though still\nsomewhat vague\u2014answer may seem to go like this: Whatever exact\npriors you are going to assign, you should assign a higher one to the\nhypothesis that explains the available data best than to any of its\nrivals (provided there is a best explanation). Note, though, that your\nneighbor, who is a Bayesian but thinks confirmation has nothing to do\nwith explanation, may well assign a prior to the best explanation that\nis even higher than the one you assign to that hypothesis. In fact,\nhis priors for best explanations may even be consistently higher than\nyours, not because in his view explanation is somehow related to\nconfirmation\u2014it is not, he thinks\u2014but, well, just because.\nIn this context, \u201cjust because\u201d is a perfectly legitimate\nreason, because any reason for fixing one\u2019s priors counts as\nlegitimate by Bayesian standards. According to mainstream Bayesian\nepistemology, priors (and sometimes likelihoods) are up for grabs,\nmeaning that one assignment of priors is as good as another, provided\nboth are coherent (that is, they obey the axioms of probability\ntheory). Lipton\u2019s recommendation to the Bayesian to be an\nexplanationist is meant to be entirely general. But what should your\nneighbor do differently if he wants to follow the recommendation?\nShould he give the same prior to any best explanation that you, his\nexplanationist neighbor, give to it, that is, lower his\npriors for best explanations? Or rather should he give even\nhigher priors to best explanations than those he already\ngives? \nPerhaps Lipton\u2019s proposal is not intended to address those who\nalready assign highest priors to best explanations, even if they do so\non grounds that have nothing to do with explanation. The idea might be\nthat, as long as one does assign highest priors to those hypotheses,\neverything is fine, or at least finer than if one does not do so,\nregardless of one\u2019s reasons for assigning those priors. The\nanswer to the question of how explanatory considerations are to guide\none\u2019s choice of priors would then presumably be that one ought\nto assign a higher prior to the best explanation than to its rivals,\nif this is not what one already does. If it is, one should just keep\ndoing what one is doing. \n(As an aside, it should be noticed that, according to standard\nBayesian usage, the term \u201cpriors\u201d does not necessarily\nrefer to the degrees of belief a person assigns before the receipt of\nany data. If there are already data in, then, clearly, one\nmay assign higher priors to hypotheses that best explain the\nthen-available data. However, one can sensibly speak of \u201cbest\nexplanations\u201d even before any data are known. For example, one\nhypothesis may be judged to be a better explanation than any of its\nrivals because the former requires less complicated mathematics, or\nbecause it is stated in terms of familiar concepts only, which is not\ntrue of the others. More generally, such judgments may be based on\nwhat Kosso (1992, 30) calls internal features of hypotheses\nor theories, that is, features that \u201ccan be evaluated without\nhaving to observe the world.\u201d) \nA more interesting answer to the above question of how explanation is\nto guide one\u2019s choice of priors has been given by Jonathan\nWeisberg (2009). We said that mainstream Bayesians regard one\nassignment of prior probabilities as being as good as any other.\nSo-called objective Bayesians do not do so, however. These Bayesians\nthink priors must obey principles beyond the probability axioms in\norder to be admissible. Objective Bayesians are divided among\nthemselves over exactly which further principles are to be obeyed, but\nat least for a while they agreed that the Principle of Indifference is\namong them. Roughly stated, this principle counsels that, absent a\nreason to the contrary, we give equal priors to competing hypotheses.\nAs is well known, however, in its original form the Principle of\nIndifference may lead to inconsistent assignments of probabilities and\nso can hardly be advertised as a principle of rationality. The problem\nis that there are typically various ways to partition logical space\nthat appear plausible given the problem at hand, and that not all of\nthem lead to the same prior probability assignment, even assuming the\nPrinciple of Indifference. Weisberg\u2019s proposal amounts to the\nclaim that explanatory considerations may favor some of those\npartitions over others. Perhaps we will not always end up with a\nunique partition to which the Principle of Indifference is to be\napplied, but it would already be progress if we ended up with only a\nhandful of partitions. For we could then still arrive in a motivated\nway at our prior probabilities, by proceeding in two steps, namely, by\nfirst applying the Principle of Indifference to the partitions\nseparately, thereby possibly obtaining different assignments of\npriors, and by then taking a weighted average of the thus obtained\npriors, where the weights, too, are to depend on explanatory\nconsiderations. The result would again be a probability\nfunction\u2014the uniquely correct prior probability function,\naccording to Weisberg. \nThe proposal is intriguing as far as it goes but, as Weisberg admits,\nin its current form, it does not go very far. For one thing, it is\nunclear how exactly explanatory considerations are to determine the\nweights required for the second step of the proposal. For another, it\nmay be idle to hope that taking explanatory considerations into\naccount will in general leave us with a manageable set of partitions,\nor that, even if it does, this will not be due merely to the fact that\nwe are overlooking a great many prima facie plausible ways of\npartitioning logical space to begin with. (The latter point echoes the\nargument of the bad lot, of course.) \nAnother suggestion about the connection between abduction and Bayesian\nreasoning\u2014to be found in Okasha 2000, McGrew 2003, Lipton 2004\n(Ch. 7), and Dells\u00e9n 2018\u2014is that the explanatory\nconsiderations may serve as a heuristic to determine, even if only\nroughly, priors and likelihoods in cases in which we would otherwise\nbe clueless and could do no better than guessing. This suggestion is\nsensitive to the well-recognized fact that we are not always able to\nassign a prior to every hypothesis of interest, or to say how probable\na given piece of evidence is conditional on a given hypothesis.\nConsideration of that hypothesis\u2019 explanatory power might then\nhelp us to figure out, if perhaps only within certain bounds, what\nprior to assign to it, or what likelihood to assign to it on the given\nevidence. \nBayesians, especially the more modest ones, might want to retort that\nthe Bayesian procedure is to be followed if, and only if, either (a)\npriors and likelihoods can be determined with some precision and\nobjectivity, or (b) likelihoods can be determined with some precision\nand priors can be expected to \u201cwash out\u201d as more and more\nevidence accumulates, or (c) priors and likelihoods can both be\nexpected to wash out. In the remaining cases\u2014they might\nsay\u2014we should simply refrain from applying Bayesian reasoning. A\nfortiori, then, there is no need for an abduction-enhanced Bayesianism\nin these cases. And some incontrovertible mathematical results\nindicate that, in the cases that fall under (a), (b), or (c), our\nprobabilities will converge to the truth anyhow. Consequently, in\nthose cases there is no need for the kind of abductive heuristics that\nthe above-mentioned authors suggest, either. (Weisberg 2009, Sect.\n3.2, raises similar concerns.) \nPsillos (2000) proposes yet another way in which abduction might\nsupplement Bayesian confirmation theory, one that is very much in the\nspirit of Peirce\u2019s conception of abduction. The idea is that\nabduction may assist us in selecting plausible candidates for testing,\nwhere the actual testing then is to follow Bayesian lines. However,\nPsillos concedes (2004) that this proposal assigns a role to abduction\nthat will strike committed explanationists as being too limited. \nFinally, a possibility that has so far not been considered in the\nliterature is that abduction and Bayesianism do not so much work in\ntandem\u2014as they do on the above proposals\u2014as operate in\ndifferent modes of reasoning; the Bayesian and the explanationist are\ncharacters that feature in different plays, so to speak. It is widely\naccepted that sometimes we speak and think about our beliefs in a\ncategorical manner, while at other times we speak and think about them\nin a graded way. It is far from clear how these different ways of\nspeaking and thinking about beliefs\u2014the epistemology of belief\nand the epistemology of degrees of belief, to use Richard\nFoley\u2019s (1992) terminology\u2014are related to one another. In\nfact, it is an open question whether there is any straightforward\nconnection between the two, or even whether there is a connection at\nall. Be that as it may, given that the distinction is undeniable, it\nis a plausible suggestion that, just as there are different ways of\ntalking and thinking about beliefs, there are different ways of\ntalking and thinking about the revision of beliefs. In\nparticular, abduction could well have its home in the epistemology of\nbelief, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a\ncategorical mode, while at the same time Bayes\u2019 rule could have\nits home in the epistemology of degrees of belief. Hard-nosed\nBayesians may insist that whatever reasoning goes on in the\ncategorical mode must eventually be justifiable in Bayesian terms, but\nthis presupposes the existence of bridge principles connecting the\nepistemology of belief with the epistemology of degrees of\nbelief\u2014and, as mentioned, whether such principles exist is\npresently unclear."},"1":{"chunk_id":"152a3c729f089f88b6ceaa6c432bbd01","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":[],"chunk_type":"full_article","philosophers":["Peter Abelard","Bernard of Clairvaux"],"concepts":["Aristotle","H\u00e9lo\u00efse","Latin"],"content":"\nPeter Abelard (1079\u201321 April 1142) [\u2018Abailard\u2019 or\n\u2018Abaelard\u2019 or \u2018Habalaarz\u2019 and so on] was the\npre-eminent philosopher and theologian of the twelfth century. The\nteacher of his generation, he was also famous as a poet and a\nmusician. Prior to the recovery of Aristotle, he brought the native\nLatin tradition in philosophy to its highest pitch. His genius was\nevident in all he did. He is, arguably, the greatest logician of the\nMiddle Ages and is equally famous as the first great nominalist\nphilosopher. He championed the use of reason in matters of faith (he\nwas the first to use \u2018theology\u2019 in its modern sense), and\nhis systematic treatment of religious doctrines are as remarkable for\ntheir philosophical penetration and subtlety as they are for their\naudacity. Abelard seemed larger than life to his contemporaries: his\nquick wit, sharp tongue, perfect memory, and boundless arrogance made\nhim unbeatable in debate\u2014he was said by supporter and detractor\nalike never to have lost an argument\u2014and the force of his\npersonality impressed itself vividly on all with whom he came into\ncontact. His luckless affair with H\u00e9lo\u00efse made him a\ntragic figure of romance, and his conflict with Bernard of Clairvaux\nover reason and religion made him the hero of the Enlightenment. For\nall his colourful life, though, his philosophical achievements are the\ncornerstone of his fame.  \nAbelard\u2019s metaphysics is the first great example of nominalism\nin the Western tradition. While his view that universals are mere\nwords (nomina) justifies the label, nominalism\u2014or,\nbetter, irrealism\u2014is the hallmark of Abelard\u2019s entire\nmetaphysics. He is an irrealist not only about universals, but also\nabout propositions, events, times other than the present, natural\nkinds, relations, wholes, absolute space, hylomorphic composites, and\nthe like. Instead, Abelard holds that the concrete individual, in all\nits richness and variety, is more than enough to populate the world.\nAbelard preferred reductive, atomist, and material explanations\nwhenever possible; he devoted a great deal of effort to pouring cold\nwater on the metaphysical excesses of his predecessors and\ncontemporaries. \nAbelard defends his thesis that universals are nothing but words by\narguing that ontological realism about universals is incoherent. More\nexactly, he holds that there cannot be any real object in the world\nsatisfying Boethius\u2019s criteria for the universal, namely\nsomething present as a whole in many at once so as to constitute their\nsubstance (i.e. to make the individual in which it is present what it\nis). Hence, Abelard concludes, universality is not an ontological\nfeature of the world but a semantic feature of language. \nSuppose universals were things in the world, so that one and the same\nitem is completely present in both Socrates and an ass at the same\ntime, making each to be wholly an animal. Abelard points out that then\nthe same thing, animal, will be simultaneously rational (due\nto its role in constituting the species human being) and\nirrational (due to its role in constituting the species ass).\nBut then contraries are simultaneously present in the same thing as a\nwhole, which is impossible. \nTo the rejoinder that rationality and irrationality are not actually\npresent in the same thing, Abelard offers a twofold reply. First, he\nrejects the claim that they are present only potentially. Each species\nis actually informed by a contrary, and the genus is actually present\nin each as a whole; hence it is actually informed by one contrary in\none species and by the other in the other; since it is wholly one and\nthe same in each, it is therefore actually informed by contraries, and\nthe contradiction results. Second, Abelard undertakes to establish\nthat contraries will be present not merely in the genus but even in\nthe selfsame individual. For Socrates is (an) animal, and so is\nBrunellus the Ass; but by transitivity\u2014since each is wholly and\ncompletely animal\u2014Socrates is Brunellus, and hence both\nrational and irrational. Put a different way, each is essentially an\nanimal, and furthermore essentially rational and essentially\nirrational. \nIf we object to this last piece of reasoning, on the grounds that\nindividuals are unique in virtue of their non-essential features,\nAbelard replies that this view \u201cmakes accidents prior to\nsubstance.\u201d That is, the objection claims that individual things\nare individual in virtue of features that contingently characterize\nthem, which confuses things with their features. \nProspects are no better for realism if the universal is identified not\nwith a single thing but with a collection of things. Abelard points\nout that collections are posterior to their parts, and, furthermore,\nthe collection is not shared among its parts in the way a universal is\nsaid to be common to many. Nor does it help to try to identify the\nuniversal with the individual in some fashion, for example in claiming\nthat Socrates qua human is taken as the universal human\nbeing; Abelard argues that if the universal really is the\nindividual, then we are stuck with the consequence that either\nindividuals such as Socrates are common to many, or there are as many\nuniversals as there are individuals, each of which is absurd. \nAbelard concludes that universality is merely linguistic, not a\nfeature of the world. More precisely, Abelard holds that common nouns\n(such as \u2018animal\u2019), verbs, and negative names (such as\n\u2018not-Socrates\u2019) are correctly predicable of many, and so\ncount as universals. These terms are semantically general, in that\ntheir sense applies to more than one thing, but they do not thereby\nname some general thing; instead, they distributively refer to each of\nthe individuals to which the term applies. For example, the term\n\u2018animal\u2019 has the sense living substance, which is\ninherently general, and it refers to each individual animal since each\nis a living substance\u2014as Abelard puts it, since each has the\nstatus of being a living substance. But this is to leave the domain of\nmetaphysics for semantics; see the discussion of Abelard\u2018s\nphilosophy of language in\n Section 4. \nAbelard maintains that everything in the world apart from God and\nangels is either form, matter, or a composite of form and matter. The\nmatter of something is that out of which it is made, whether it\npersists in the finished product (as bricks in a house) or is absorbed\ninto it (as flour in bread). Ultimately, all material objects are\ncomposed of the four elements earth, air, fire, and water, but they do\nnot retain their elemental forms in most combinations. In general, the\nform of a material object just is the configuration of its material\nparts: \u201cWe call the form strictly what comes from the\ncomposition of the parts.\u201d The form of a statue, for example, is\nits shape, which is no more than the arrangement of its\nmatter\u2014the curve of the nose, the size of the eyes, and so on.\nForms are therefore supervenient on matter, and have no\nontological standing independent of it. This is not to deny that forms\nexist, but to provide a particular explanation of what it is for a\nform to inhere in a given subject, namely for that subject to have its\nmatter configured in a certain way. For example, the inherence of\nshape in the statue just is the way in which its bronze is arranged.\nHence material things are identical with what they are made\nof\u2014with one exception: human beings, whose forms are their\nimmaterial (and immortal) souls. Strictly speaking, since human souls\nare capable of existence in separation form the body, they are not\nforms after all, though they act as substantial forms as long as they\nare joined to the body. \nMaterial composites of form and matter, humans excepted, are integral\nwholes made up of their discrete material parts as configured in a\ngiven way. Abelard countenances many types of integral wholes:\ncollections, no matter how their members are selected; structured\ncomposites, whether naturally unified (such as Socrates and his limbs)\nor artificially unified (such as the walls, floor, and roof of a\nhouse); continuous quantities that are homogeneous material\n\u2018substances,\u2019 namely stuffs, such as water or gold;\ngeometrical objects, such as lines, defined by the relative position\nof their parts; temporal wholes, such as a day and the hours that make\nit up. Most of these wholes are ontologically nothing beyond their\nmaterial parts. Whether structured composites have any independent\nontological standing depends on the status of their organizing\nforms. \nAbelard\u2019s theory of substantial integral wholes is not a pure\nmereology in the modern sense, since he holds that there are\nprivileged divisions: just as a genus is properly divided into not\njust any species but its proximate species, so too the division of a\nwhole must be into its principal parts. Intuitively, some wholes have\na natural division that takes precedence over others; a sentence, for\nexample, is divided into words, syllables, and letters, in precisely\nthat order. According to Abelard, the principal parts of a whole are\nthose whose conjunction immediately results in the complete whole. His\nintent seems to be that the nature of the composition (if any) that\ndefines the integral whole also spells out its principal parts. A\nhouse consists of floor, walls, and roof put together in the right\nway. It is an open question whether each principal part (such as the\nwall) requires the existence of all of its subparts (every brick). The\nprincipal parts of a collection, for example, are just each of the\nmembers of the collection, whatever may be the case with any given\nmember\u2019s subparts; the principal parts of an aggregation are the\nmembers located in proximity to one another. \nIndividuals have natures, and in virtue of their natures they belong\nto determinate natural kinds. But an individual\u2019s nature is not\nsomething really shared with or common to other individuals;\nAbelard\u2019s refutation of realism has shown that this is\nimpossible. Instead, Abelard takes a natural kind to be a well-defined\ncollection of things that have the same features, broadly speaking,\nthat make them what they are. Why a given thing has some features\nrather than others is explained by how it got that way\u2014the\nnatural processes that created it result in its having the features it\ndoes, namely being the kind of thing it is; similar processes lead to\nsimilar results. On this reading, it is clear that natural kinds have\nno special status; they are no more than discrete integral wholes\nwhose principle of membership is similarity, merely reflecting the\nfact that the world is divided into discrete similarity-classes of\nobjects. Furthermore, such real relations of similarity are nothing\nthemselves above and beyond the things that are similar. The division\ninto natural kinds is, presumably, a \u2018shallow fact\u2019 about\nthe world: matters could have been otherwise had God ordained them\ndifferently; fire might be cold, heavy bodies fall upwards, frogs\nreason. If these causal powers were different, then natural kinds\nmight be different as well, or might not have been as sharply\ndifferentiated as they are now. Given how matters stand, natural kinds\ncarve the world at its joints, but they are the joints chosen by\nGod. \nAbelard was the greatest logician since Antiquity: he devised a purely\ntruth-functional propositional logic, recognizing the distinction\nbetween force and content we associate with Frege,\nand worked out a complete theory of entailment as it functions in\nargument (which we now take as the theory of logical consequence). His\nlogical system is flawed in its handling of topical inference, but\nthat should not prevent our recognition of Abelard\u2019s\nachievements. \nAbelard observes that the same propositional content can be expressed\nwith different force in different contexts: the content that\nSocrates is in the house is expressed in an assertion in\n\u2018Socrates is in the house\u2019; in a question in \u2018Is\nSocrates in the house?\u2019; in a wish in \u2018If only Socrates\nwere in the house!\u2019 and so on. Hence Abelard can distinguish in\nparticular the assertive force of a sentence from its propositional\ncontent, a distinction that allows him to point out that the component\nsentences in a conditional statement are not asserted, though they\nhave the same content they do when asserted\u2014\u2018If Socrates\nis in the kitchen, then Socrates is in the house\u2019 does not\nassert that Socrates is in the kitchen or that he is in the house, nor\ndo the antecedent or the consequent, although the same form of words\ncould be used outside the scope of the conditional to make such\nassertions. Likewise, the distinction allows Abelard to define\nnegation, and other propositional connectives, purely\ntruth-functionally in terms of content, so that negation, for\ninstance, is treated as follows: not-p is false\/true if and\nonly if p is true\/false. \nThe key to the theory of argument, for Abelard, is found in\ninferentia, best rendered as \u2018entailment\u2019, since\nAbelard requires the connection between the propositions involved to\nbe both necessary and relevant. That is, the conclusion\u2014more\nexactly, the sense of the final statement\u2014is required by the\nsense of the preceding statement(s), so that it cannot be otherwise.\nAbelard often speaks of the sense of the final statement being\n\u201ccontained\u201d in the sense of the preceding statement(s),\nmuch as we speak of the conclusion being contained in the premisses.\nAn entailment is complete (perfecta) when it holds in virtue\nof the logical form (complexio) of the propositions involved.\nBy this, Abelard tells us, he means that the entailment holds under\nany uniform substitution in its terms, the criterion now associated\nwith Bolzano. The traditional four figures and moods of the\ncategorical syllogism derived from Aristotle, and the doctrine of the\nhypothetical syllogism derived from Boethius, are all instances of\ncomplete entailments, or as we should say, valid inference. \nThere is another way in which conclusions can be necessary and\nrelevant to their premisses, yet not be formally valid (not\nbe a complete entailment). The necessary connection among the\npropositions, and the link among their senses, might be a function of\nnon-formal metaphysical truths holding in all possible worlds. For\ninstance, human beings are a kind of animal, so the consequence\n\u2018If Socrates is a human being, Socrates is an animal\u2019\nholds of necessity and the sense of the antecedent compels that of the\nconsequent, but it is not formally valid under uniform substitution.\nAbelard takes such incomplete entailments to hold according to the\ntheory of the topics (to be forms of so-called topical inference). The\nsample inference above is validated by the topic \u201cfrom the\nspecies\u201d, a set of metaphysical relations one of which is\nexpressible in the rule \u201cWhatever the species is predicated of,\nso too is the genus\u201d which grounds the inferential force of the\nentailment. Against Boethius, Abelard maintained that topical rules\nwere only needed for incomplete entailment, and in particular are not\nrequired to validate the classical moods of the categorical and\nhypothetical syllogism mentioned in the preceding paragraph. \nAbelard spends a great deal of effort to explore the complexities of\nthe theory of topical inference, especially charting the precise\nrelations among conditional sentences, arguments, and what he calls\n\u201cargumentation\u201d (roughly what follows from conceded\npremisses). One of the surprising results of his investigation is that\nhe denies that a correlate of the Deduction Theorem holds, maintaining\nthat a valid argument need not correspond to an acceptable conditional\nsentence, nor conversely, since the requirements on arguments and\nconditionals differ. \nIn the end, it seems that Abelard\u2019s principles of topical\ninference do not work, a fact that became evident with regard to the\ntopic \u201cfrom opposites\u201d: Abelard\u2019s principles lead to\ninconsistent results, a result noted by Alberic of Paris. This led to\na crisis in the theory of inference in the twelfth century, since\nAbelard unsuccessfully tried to evade the difficulty. These debates\nseem to have taken place in the later part of the 1130s, as Abelard\nwas about to become embroiled with Bernard of Clairvaux, and his\nattention was elsewhere. \nMuch of Abelard\u2019s philosophy of language is devoted to analyzing\nhow a given expression or class of expressions function logically:\nwhat words are quantifiers, which imply negation, and the like, so\nthat the logic described above may be applied. To do so, he relies on\nthe traditional division, derived from Aristotle, that sees the main\nlinguistic categories as name, verb, and their\ncombination into the sentence. \nAbelard takes names to be conventionally significant simple words,\nusually without tense. So understood there are a wide variety of\nnames: proper and common names; adjectives and adverbs; pronouns,\nwhether personal, possessive, reflexive, or relative; conventional\ninterjections such as \u2018Goodness!\u2019; and, arguably,\nconjunctions and prepositions (despite lacking definite\nsignification), along with participles and gerundives (which have\ntense). Abelard usually, though not always, treats compound names such\nas \u2018street-sweeper\u2019 reductively. Even so his list is not\ngeneral enough to catalogue all referring expressions. In point of\nfact, much of Abelard\u2019s discussion of the semantics of names\nturns on a particular case that stands for the rest: common names.\nThese are at the heart of the problem of universals, and they pose\nparticular difficulties for semantics. \nWhen Abelard puts forward his claim that universality is only a\nlinguistic phenomenon, so that universals are \u201cnothing more than\nwords,\u201d he raises the objection that unless common names are the\nnames of common items, they will be meaningless, and so his view is no\nbetter than that of his teacher Roscelin (who held that universals\nwere mere mouth noises). In reply Abelard clearly draws a distinction\nbetween two semantic properties names possess: reference\n(nominatio), a matter of what the term applies to; and sense\n(significatio), a matter of what hearing the term brings to\nmind, or more exactly the informational content (doctrina) of\nthe concept the word is meant to give rise to, a causal notion. A few\nremarks about each are in order. \nNames, both proper and common, refer to things individually or\nseverally. A name is linked with that of which it is the name as\nthough there were someone who devised the name to label a given thing\nor kind of thing, a process known as \u201cimposition\u201d\n(modelled on Adam\u2019s naming the animals in Genesis 2:19), rather\nlike baptism. This rational reconstruction of reference does not\nrequire the person imposing the name, the \u201cimpositor\u201d, to\nhave anything more than an indefinite intention to pick out the thing\nor kind of thing, whatever its nature may be: \nThe inventor [of names] intended to impose them according to some\nnatures or distinctive properties of things, even if he himself did\nnot know how to think correctly upon the nature or distinctive\nproperty of a thing.\n \nA name \u201chas a definition in the nature of its imposition, even\nif we do not know what it is.\u201d Put in modern terms, Abelard\nholds a theory of direct reference, in which the extension of\na term is not a function of its sense. We are often completely\nignorant of the proper conceptual content that should be associated\nwith a term that has been successfully imposed. \nA proper name\u2014the name of a primary substance\u2014signifies a\nconcrete individual (hoc aliquid), picking out its bearer as\npersonally distinct from all else. Therefore, proper names are\nsemantically singular referring expressions, closely allied to\nindexicals, demonstratives, and singular descriptions (or descriptive\nterms). Common names, by contrast, are semantically allied with\nexpressions that have what Abelard calls \u201cplural\nsignification\u201d. On the one hand, common names are like plural\nnouns; the common name \u2018man\u2019 is grammatically singular but\noperates like the plural term \u2018men\u2019\u2014each refers to\nevery man, although the plural term signifies individuals as part of a\ncollection, whereas the common name distributively refers to each\nindividual. On the other hand, common names are like terms such as\n\u2018trio\u2019 or \u2018pair\u2019 in that they pick out a\ndeterminate plurality of individuals, but only on an occasion of use,\nsince their extension is variable. \nThus a common name distributively refers to concrete individuals,\nthough not to them qua individuals. Instead, it severally\npicks out those individuals having a given nature: \u2018human\nbeing\u2019 refers to Socrates and to Plato, in virtue of each of\nthem being human. This is not a shared feature of any sort; Socrates\njust is what he is, namely human, and likewise Plato is what he is,\nnamely human too. Abelard states his deflationary position clearly in\nhis Logica \u2018ingredientibus\u2019: \nNow it seems we should stay away from accepting the agreement among\nthings according to what is not any thing\u2014it\u2019s as though\nwe were to unite in nothing things that now exist!\u2014namely, when\nwe say that this [human] and that one agree in the human status, that\nis to say: in that they are human. But we mean precisely that they are\nhuman and don\u2019t differ in this regard\u2014let me repeat: [they\ndon\u2019t differ] in that they are human, although we\u2019re not\nappealing to any thing [in this explanation].\n \nSocrates and Plato are real; their agreement is real, too, but it\nisn\u2019t to be explained by appealing to any thing\u2014their\nagreement just is their each being human. From a metaphysical point of\nview they have the same standing as human beings; this does not\ninvolve any metaphysically common shared ingredient, or indeed appeal\nto any ingredient at all. That is the sense in which there is a\n\u201ccommon reason\u201d for the imposition of a common name.  \nFor all that signification is posterior to reference, names do have\nsignification as well. Abelard holds that the signification of a term\nis the informational content of the concept that is associated with\nthe term upon hearing it, in the normal course of events. Since names\nare only conventionally significant, which concept is associated with\na given name depends in part on the psychological conditioning of\nlanguage-users, in virtue of which Abelard can treat signification as\nboth a causal and a normative notion: the word \u2018rabbit\u2019\nought to cause native speakers of English to have the concept of a\nrabbit upon hearing it. Abelard is careful to insist that the\nsignification is a matter of the informational content carried in the\nconcept\u2014mere psychological associations, even the mental images\ncharacteristic of a given concept, are not part of what the word\nmeans. Ideally, the concept will correspond to a real\ndefinition that latches onto the nature of the thing, the way\n\u2018rational mortal animal\u2019 is thought to be the real\ndefinition of \u2018human being\u2019, regardless of other\nassociated features (even necessary features such as risibility) or\nfortuitous images (as any mental image of a human will be of someone\nwith determinate features). Achieving such clarity in our concepts is,\nof course, an arduous business, and requires an understanding of how\nunderstanding itself works (see the discussion of Abelard\u2019s\nphilosophy of mind in\n Section 5).\n Yet one point should be clear from the example. The significations of\nsome names, such as those corresponding to natural-kind terms, are\nabstractions in the sense that they include only certain features of\nthe things to which the term refers. They do not positively exclude\nall other features, though, and are capable of further determinate\nspecification: \u2018rational mortal animal\u2019 as the content of\nthe concept of \u2018human being\u2019 signifies all humans,\nwhatever their further features may be\u2014tall or short, fat or\nthin, male or female, and so on. \nWhat holds for the semantics of names applies for the most part to\nverbs. The feature that sets verbs apart from names, more so than\ntense or grammatical person, is that verbs have connective force\n(vis copulativa). This is a primitive and irreducible feature\nof verbs that can only be discharged when they are joined with names\nin the syntactically appropriate way, reminiscent of the\n\u2018unsaturatedness\u2019 of concepts in Frege. Sentences are made\nup of names and verbs in such a way that the meaning of the whole\nsentence is a function of the meaning of its parts. That is,\nAbelardian semantics is fundamentally compositional in nature. The\ndetails of how the composition works are complex. Abelard works\ndirectly with a natural language (Latin) that, for all its\nartificiality, is still a native second tongue. Hence there are many\nlinguistic phenomena Abelard is compelled to analyze that would be\nsimply disallowed in a more formal framework. \nFor example, Abelard notes that most verbs can occur as predicates in\ntwo ways, namely as a finite verbal form or as a nominal form combined\nwith an auxiliary copula, so that we may say either \u2018Socrates\nruns\u2019 or \u2018Socrates is running\u2019; the same holds for\ntransitive predication, for instance \u2018Socrates hits Plato\u2019\nand \u2018Socrates is hitting Plato.\u2019 Abelard argues that in\ngeneral the pure verbal version of predication is the fundamental\nform, which explains and clarifies the extended version; the latter is\nonly strictly necessary where simple verbal forms are lacking. (The\nsubstantive verb \u2018is\u2019 requires special treatment.) Hence\nfor Abelard the basic analysis of a predicative statement recognizes\nthat two fundamentally different linguistic categories are joined\ntogether: the name n and the simple verbal function\nV( ), combined in the well-formed sentence\nV(n). \nAbelard argues that sentences (propositiones) must signify\nmore than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb.\nFirst, a sentence such as \u2018Socrates runs\u2019 deals with\nSocrates and with running, not with anyone\u2019s understandings. We\ntalk about the world, not merely someone\u2019s understanding of the\nworld. Second, sentences like \u2018If something is human, it is an\nanimal\u2019 are false if taken to be about understandings, for\nsomeone could entertain the concept human without\nentertaining the concept animal, and so the antecedent would\nobtain without the consequent. Third, understandings are evanescent\nparticulars, mere mental tokenings of concepts. But at least some\nconsequential sentences are necessary, and necessity can\u2019t be\ngrounded on things that are transitory, and so not on understandings.\nSentences must therefore signify something else in addition to\nunderstandings, something that can do what mere understandings cannot.\nAbelard describes this as signifying what the sentence says, calling\nwhat is said by the sentence its dictum (plural\ndicta). \nTo the modern philosophical ear, Abelard\u2019s dicta might\nsound like propositions, abstract entities that are the timeless\nbearers of truth and falsity. But Abelard will have nothing to do with\nany such entities. He declares repeatedly and emphatically that\ndespite being more than and different from the sentences that express\nthem, dicta have no ontological standing whatsoever. In the\nshort space of a single paragraph he says that they are \u201cno real\nthings at all\u201d and twice calls them \u201cabsolutely\nnothing.\u201d They underwrite sentences, but they aren\u2019t real\nthings. For although a sentence says something, there is not some\nthing that it says. The semantic job of sentences is to say\nsomething, which is not to be confused with naming or denoting some\nthing. It is instead a matter of proposing how things are, provided\nthis is not given a realist reading. Likewise, the truth of true\nsentences is not a property inhering in some timeless entity, but no\nmore than the assertion of what the sentence says\u2014that is,\nAbelard adopts a deflationary account of truth. A sentence is true if\nthings stand in the way it says, and things make sentences true or\nfalse in virtue of the way they are (as well as in virtue of what the\nsentences say), and nothing further is required. The sentence\n\u2018Socrates runs\u2019 is true because Socrates runs, which is\nall that can be said or needs to be said. \nAristotelian philosophy of mind offers two analyses of intentionality:\nthe conformality theory holds that we think of an object by having its\nvery form in the mind, the resemblance theory that we do so by having\na mental image in the mind that naturally resembles the object.\nAbelard rejects each of these theories and proposes instead an\nadverbial theory of thought, showing that neither mental images nor\nmental contents need be countenanced as ontologically independent of\nthe mind. He gives a contextual explication of intentionality that\nrelies on a linguistic account of mental representation, adopting a\nprinciple of compositionality for understandings. \nThe first Aristotelian analysis takes understanding to be the\nmind\u2019s acquisition of the form of the object that is understood,\nwithout its matter. For an understanding to be about some\nthing\u2014say, a cat\u2014is for the form of the cat to be in the\nmind or intellective soul. The inherence of the form in matter makes\nthe matter to be a thing of a certain kind, so that the inherence of\nthe form cat in matter produces an actual cat, whereas the\n(immaterial) inherence of the form cat in the mind transforms\nthe mind into an understanding of a cat: the mind becomes (formally)\nidentical with its object. Since the \u2018aboutness\u2019 of\nunderstanding is analyzed as the commonness or identity of form in the\nunderstanding and the thing understood, we may call this approach the\nconformality theory of understanding. This theory captures\nthe intuition that understanding somehow inherits or includes\nproperties of what is understood, by reducing the intentionality of\nunderstanding to the objective identity of the form in the mind and\nthe form in the world. \nThe second Aristotelian analysis takes understanding to be the\nmind\u2019s possession of a concept that is a natural likeness of, or\nnaturally similar to, that of which it is a concept. For an\nunderstanding to be about some thing, such as a cat, is for there to\nbe an occurrent concept in the mind that is a natural likeness of a\ncat. The motivation for calling the likeness \u201cnatural\u201d is\nto guarantee that the resemblance between the understanding and what\nis understood is objective, and that all persons have access to the\nsame stock of concepts. (The conformality theory does this by\npostulating the objective existence of forms in things and by an\nidentical process in all persons of assimilating or acquiring forms.)\nWe may call this approach the resemblance theory of\nunderstanding: mental acts are classified according to the distinct\ndegree and kind of resemblance they have to the things that are\nunderstood. \nThe resemblance theory faces well-known problems in spelling out the\ncontent of resemblance or likeness. For example, a concept is clearly\nimmaterial, and as such radically differs from any material object.\nFurthermore, there seems to be no formal characteristic of a mental\nact in virtue of which it can non-trivially be said to resemble\nanything else. To get around these difficulties, mediaeval\nphilosophers, like the British Empiricists centuries later, appealed\nto a particular kind of resemblance, namely pictorial resemblance. A\nportrait of Socrates is about Socrates in virtue of visually\nresembling Socrates in the right ways. And just as there are pictorial\nimages that are about their subjects, so too are there mental images\nthat are about things. These mental images, whether they are concepts\nor are contained in concepts, explain the way in which a concept is\n\u2018about\u2019 an object. For an understanding to be about a cat\nis for it to be or contain a mental image of a cat. The phenomenon of\nmental \u2018aboutness\u2019 is explicated by the more familiar case\nof pictorial aboutness, itself reduced to a real relation of\nresemblance. \nDespite their common Aristotelian heritage, the conformality theory\nand the resemblance theory are not equivalent. The transformation of\nthe mind through the inherence of a form is not necessarily the same\nas the mind\u2019s possession of a concept. Equally, natural likeness\nor resemblance need not be understood as identity of form; formal\nidentity need not entail genuine resemblance, due to the different\nsubjects in which the form is embodied. \nThe standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the\nresemblance theory is to take the mind\u2019s possession of a concept\nto be its ability to transform itself through the inherence of a form,\nconstruing formal identity as natural likeness, where having a form in\nthe mind that is identical to the form of the object understood just\nis to have a mental image of that very object. \nAbelard argues against conformality as follows. Consider a tower,\nwhich is a material object with a certain length, depth, and height;\nassume that these features compose its form, much as the shape of a\nstatue is its form. According to Aristotelian metaphysics, the\ninherence of a form in a subject makes the subject into something\ncharacterized by that form, as for instance whiteness inhering in\nSocrates makes him something white. The forms of the tower likewise\nmake that in which they inhere to be tall, wide, massive\u2014all\nphysical properties. If these forms inhere in the mind, then, they\nshould make the mind tall, wide, and massive, an absurd conclusion:\nthe mind \u201ccannot extend itself in length or width.\u201d Yet it\nis a cardinal thesis of the conformality theory that the mind has the\nidentical form that is possessed by the external object, the tower,\nalthough the form of (say) length is by its very nature physical.\nThus, Abelard concludes, conformality is incoherent. \nAbelard\u2019s main objection to the resemblance theory is that\nmental images qua images, like any sign, are inert: they\nrequire interpretation. A sign is just an object. It may be taken in a\nsignificative role, though it need not be. Abelard notes that this\ndistinction holds equally for non-mental signs: we can treat a statue\nas a lump of bronze or as a likeness. Mental images are likewise\ninert. For a sign to function significatively, then, something more is\nrequired beyond its mere presence or existence. But the resemblance\ntheory doesn\u2019t recognize the need to interpret the mental image\nas an image, and thereby mistakenly identifies understanding with the\nmere presence of a mental image in the mind. Abelard concludes that\nmental images have only an instrumental role in thought, describing\nthem as \u201cintermediary signs of things\u201d (intersigna\nrerum). Intentionality derives instead from the act of attention\n(attentio) directed upon the mental image. Proof is found in\nthe fact that that we can \u201cvary the understanding\u201d simply\nby attending to different features of the mental image: the selfsame\nimage\u2014say, a fig tree\u2014can be used to think about this very\nfig tree, or trees in general, or plant life, or my lost love with\nwhom I sat under it, or anything whatsoever. There is no intrinsic\nfeature of the mental image in virtue of which it is about any given\nthing; if there were, Abelard notes, we could determine by inspection\nwhat a sign is about\u2014but we can\u2019t. Mental images,\ntherefore, can\u2019t explain the intentionality of understanding,\nbecause their role is merely instrumental. We think with them, and\ncannot avoid them; but they do not explain intentionality. \nAbelard draws the conclusion that intentionality is a primitive and\nirreducible feature of the mind, our acts of attending to things.\nDifferent acts of attention are intrinsically different from one\nanother; they are about what they are about in virtue of being the\nkind of attention they are. Hence Abelard adopts what is nowadays\ncalled an adverbial theory of thought. \nGiven that intentionality is primitive, Abelard adopts a contextual\napproach to mental content: he embeds these irreducible acts of\nattention in a structure whose articulation helps define the character\nof its constituent elements. The structure Abelard offers is\nlinguistic, a logic of mental acts: just as words can be said to\nexpress thoughts, so too we can use the articulated logic of language\nto give a theory of understanding. In short, Abelard gives something\nvery like a linguistic account of mental representation or\nintentionality. To this end he embraces a principle of\ncompositionality, holding that what an understanding is about is a\nfunction of what its constituent understandings are about. The unity\nof the understanding of a complex is a function of its logical\nsimplicity, which is characterized by the presence of what Abelard\ncalls \u201ca single dominant conjunction\u201d (the logical\noperator of greatest scope). Hence the understanding of a complex may\nbe treated as a complex of distinct understandings, aggregated in the\nsame thought, with its (logical) structure flowing from the\n\u2018dominant conjunction\u2019 over the other logical operations\ngoverning its constituent understandings. Abelard\u2019s acts of\nattention thus display the logical structure of the understanding they\nexpress, and thereby give the semantics of written or spoken language.\nMuch of Abelard\u2019s writings on logic and dialectic are given over\nto working out the details as a scheme for explicating mental\ncontent. \nAbelard takes the rational core of traditional Christian morality to\nbe radically intentionalist, based on the following\nprinciple: the agent\u2019s intention alone determines the moral\nworth of an action. His main argument against the moral relevance of\nconsequences turns on what contemporary philosophers often refer to as\nmoral luck. Suppose two men each have the money and the intention to\nestablish shelters for the poor, but one is robbed before he can act\nwhereas the second is able to carry out his intention. According to\nAbelard, to think that there is a moral difference between them is to\nhold that \u201cthe richer men were the better they could become\n\u2026 this is the height of insanity!\u201d Deed-centred morality\nloses any kind of purchase on what might have been the case. Likewise,\nit cannot offer any ground for taking the epistemic status of the\nagent into account, although most people would admit that ignorance\ncan morally exculpate an agent. Abelard makes the point with the\nfollowing example: imagine the case of fraternal twins, brother and\nsister, who are separated at birth and each kept in complete ignorance\nof even the existence of the other; as adults they meet, fall in love,\nare legally married and have sexual intercourse. Technically this is\nincest, but Abelard finds no fault in either to lay blame. \nAbelard concludes that in themselves deeds are morally indifferent.\nThe proper subject of moral evaluation is the agent, via his or her\nintentions. It might be objected that the performance or\nnonperformance of the deed could affect the agent\u2019s feelings,\nwhich in turn may affect his or her intentions, so that deeds thereby\nhave moral relevance (at least indirectly). Abelard denies it: \nFor example, if someone forces a monk to lie bound in chains between\ntwo women, and by the softness of the bed and the touch of the women\nbeside him he is brought to pleasure (but not to consent), who may\npresume to call this pleasure, which nature makes necessary, a fault?\n \nWe are so constructed that the feeling of pleasure is inevitable in\ncertain situations: sexual intercourse, eating delicious food, and the\nlike. If sexual pleasure in marriage is not sinful, then the pleasure\nitself, inside or outside of marriage, is not sinful; if it is sinful,\nthen marriage cannot sanctify it\u2014and if the conclusion were\ndrawn that such acts should be performed wholly without pleasure, then\nAbelard declares they cannot be done at all, and it was unreasonable\n(of God) to permit them only in a way in which they cannot be\nperformed. \nOn the positive side, Abelard argues that unless intentions are the\nkey ingredient in assessing moral value it is hard to see why\ncoercion, in which one is forced to do something against his or her\nwill, should exculpate the agent; likewise for ignorance\u2014though\nAbelard points out that the important moral notion is not simply\nignorance but strictly speaking negligence. Abelard takes an extreme\ncase to make his point. He argues that the crucifiers of Christ were\nnot evil in crucifying Jesus. (This example, and others like it, got\nAbelard into trouble with the authorities, and it isn\u2019t hard to\nsee why.) Their ignorance of Christ\u2019s divine nature didn\u2019t\nby itself make them evil; neither did their acting on their (false and\nmistaken) beliefs, in crucifying Christ. Their non-negligent ignorance\nremoves blame from their actions. Indeed, Abelard argues that they\nwould have sinned had they thought crucifying Christ was required and\ndid not crucify Christ: regardless of the facts of the case,\nfailing to abide by one\u2019s conscience in moral action renders the\nagent blameworthy. \nThere are two obvious objections to Abelard\u2019s intentionalism.\nFirst, how is it possible to commit evil voluntarily? Second, since\nintentions are not accessible to anyone other than the agent,\ndoesn\u2019t Abelard\u2019s view entail that it is impossible to\nmake ethical judgements? \nWith regard to the first objection, Abelard has a twofold answer.\nFirst, it is clear that we often want to perform the deed and at the\nsame time do not want to suffer the punishment. A man wants to have\nsexual intercourse with a woman, but not to commit adultery; he would\nprefer it if she were unmarried. Second, it is clear that we sometimes\n\u201cwant what we by no means want to want\u201d: our bodies react\nwith pleasure and desire independently of our wills. If we act on such\ndesires, then our action is done \u201cof\u201d will, as Abelard\ncalls it, though not voluntarily. There is nothing evil in desire:\nthere is only evil in acting on desire, and this is compatible with\nhaving contrary desires. \nWith regard to the second objection, Abelard grants that other humans\ncannot know the agent\u2019s intentions\u2014God, of course, does\nhave access to internal mental states, and so there can be a Final\nJudgement. However, Abelard does not take ethical judgement to pose a\nproblem. God is the only one with a right to pass judgement. Yet this\nfact doesn\u2019t prevent us from enforcing canons of human justice,\nbecause, Abelard holds, human justice has primarily an exemplary and\ndeterrent function. In fact, Abelard argues, it can even be just to\npunish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. He cites\ntwo cases. First, a woman accidentally smothers her baby while trying\nto keep it warm at night, and is overcome with grief. Abelard\nmaintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her\npunishment may have on others: it may make other poor mothers more\ncareful not to accidentally smother their babies while trying to keep\nthem warm. Second, a judge may have excellent (but legally\nimpermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself; since he\ncannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on\nthe basis of the witness\u2019s testimony that the accused, whom he\nbelieves to be innocent, is guilty. Human justice may with propriety\nignore questions of intention. Since there is divine justice, ethical\nnotions are not an idle wheel\u2014nor should they be, even on\nAbelard\u2019s understanding of human justice, since they are the\nmeans by which we determine which intentions to promote or discourage\nwhen we punish people as examples or in order to deter others. \nThere is a sense, then, in which the only certifiable sin is acting\nagainst one\u2019s conscience, unless one is morally negligent. Yet\nif we cannot look to the intrinsic value of the deeds or their\nconsequences, how do we determine which acts are permissible or\nobligatory? Unless conscience has a reliable guide, Abelard\u2019s\nposition seems to open the floodgates to well-meaning\nsubjectivism. \nAbelard solves the problem by taking obedience to God\u2019s\nwill\u2014the hallmark of morally correct behaviour, and itself an\ninstance of natural law\u2014to be a matter of the agent\u2019s\nintention conforming to a purely formal criterion, namely the Golden\nRule (\u201cDo to others as you would be done to\u201d). This\ncriterion can be discovered by reason alone, without any special\nrevelation or religious belief, and is sufficient to ensure the\nrightness of the agent\u2019s intention. But the resolution of this\nproblem immediately leads to another problem. Even if we grant Abelard\nhis naturalistic ethics, why should an agent care if his or her\nintentions conform to the Golden Rule? In short, even if Abelard were\nright about morality, why be moral? \nAbelard\u2019s answer is that our happiness\u2014to which no one is\nindifferent\u2014is linked to virtue, that is, to habitual morally\ncorrect behaviour. Indeed, Abelard\u2019s project in the\nCollationes is to argue that reason can prove that a merely\nnaturalistic ethics is insufficient, and that an agent\u2019s\nhappiness is necessarily bound up with accepting the principles of\ntraditional Christian belief, including the belief in God and an\nAfterlife. In particular, he argues that the Afterlife is a condition\nto which we ought to aspire, that it is a moral improvement even on\nthe life of virtue in this world, and that recognizing this is\nconstitutive of wanting to do what God wants, that is, to live\naccording to the Golden Rule, which guarantees as much as anything can\n(pending divine grace) our long-term postmortem happiness. \nThe Philosopher first argues with the Jew, who espouses a\n\u2018strict observance\u2019 moral theory, namely obedience to the\nMosaic Law. One of the arguments the Jew offers is the Slave\u2019s\nWager (apparently the earliest-known version of Pascal\u2019s Wager).\nImagine that a Slave is told one morning by someone he doesn\u2019t\nknow whether to trust that his powerful and irritable Master, who is\naway for the day, has left instructions about what to do in his\nabsence. The Slave can follow the instructions or not. He reasons that\nif the Master indeed left the instructions, then by following them he\nwill be rewarded and by not following them he will be severely\npunished, whereas if the Master did not leave the instructions he\nwould not be punished for following them, though he might be lightly\npunished for not following them. (This conforms to the standard payoff\nmatrix for Pascal\u2019s Wager.) That is the position the Jew finds\nhimself in: God has apparently demanded unconditional obedience to the\nMosaic Law, the instructions left behind. The Philosopher argues that\nthe Jew may have other choices of action and, in any event, that there\nare rational grounds for thinking that ethics is not a matter of\naction in conformity to law but a matter of the agent\u2019s\nintentions, as we have seen above. \nThe Philosopher then argues with the Christian. He initially maintains\nthat virtue entails happiness, and hence there is no need of an\nAfterlife since a virtuous person remains in the same condition\nwhether dead or alive. The Christian, however, reasons that the\nAfterlife is better, since in addition to the benefits conferred by\nliving virtuously, the agent\u2019s will is no longer impeded by\ncircumstances. In the Afterlife we are no longer subject to the body,\nfor instance, and hence are not bound by physical necessities such as\nfood, shelter, clothing, and the like. The agent can therefore be as\npurely happy as life in accordance with virtue could permit, when no\nexternal circumstances could affect the agent\u2019s actions. The\nPhilosopher grants that the Afterlife so understood is a clear\nimprovement even on the virtuous life in this world, and joins with\nthe Christian in a cooperative endeavour to define the nature of the\nvirtues and the Supreme Good. Virtue is its own reward, and in the\nAfterlife nothing prevents us from rewarding ourselves with virtue to\nthe fullest extent possible. \nAbelard held that reasoning has a limited role to play in matters of\nfaith. That he gave reasoning a role at all brought him into conflict\nwith those we might now call anti-dialecticians, including\nhis fellow abbot Bernard of Clairvaux. That the role he gave it is\nlimited brought him into conflict with those he called\n\u201cpseudo-dialecticians,\u201d including his former teacher\nRoscelin. \nBernard of Clairvaux and other anti-dialecticians seem to have thought\nthat the meaning of a proposition of the faith, to the extent that it\ncan be grasped, is plain; beyond that plain meaning, there is nothing\nwe can grasp at all, in which case reason is clearly no help. That is,\nthe anti-dialecticians were semantic realists about the plain\nmeaning of religious sentences. Hence their impatience with Abelard,\nwho seemed not only bent on obfuscating the plain meaning of\npropositions of the faith, which is bad enough, but to do so by\nreasoning, which has no place either in grasping the plain meaning\n(since the very plainness of plain meaning consists in its being\ngrasped immediately without reasoning) or in reaching some more\nprofound understanding (since only the plain meaning is open to us at\nall). \nAbelard has no patience for the semantic realism that underlies the\nsophisticated anti-dialectical position. Rather than argue against it\nexplicitly, he tries to undermine it. From his commentaries on\nscripture and dogma to his works of speculative theology, Abelard is\nfirst and foremost concerned to show how religious claims can be\nunderstood, and in particular how the application of dialectical\nmethods can clarify and illuminate propositions of the faith.\nFurthermore, he rejects the claim that there is a plain meaning to be\ngrasped. Outlining his method in the Prologue to his Sic et\nnon, Abelard describes how he initially raises a question, e.g.\nwhether priests are required to be celibate, and then arranges\ncitations from scriptural and patristic authorities that at least seem\nto answer the question directly into positive and negative responses.\n(Abelard offers advice in the Prologue for resolving the apparent\ncontradictions among the authorities using a variety of techniques:\nsee whether the words are used in the same sense on both sides; draw\nrelevant distinctions to resolve the issue; look at the context of the\ncitation; make sure that an author is speaking in his own voice rather\nthan merely reporting or paraphrasing someone else\u2019s position;\nand so on.) Now each authority Abelard cites seems to speak clearly\nand unambiguously either for a positive answer to a given question or\nfor a negative one. If ever there were cases of plain meaning, Abelard\nseems to have found them in authorities, on opposing sides of\ncontroversial issues. His advice in the Prologue amounts to saying\nthat sentences that seem to be perfect exemplars of plain meaning in\nfact have to be carefully scrutinized to see just what their meaning\nis. Yet that is just to say that they do not have plain meaning at\nall; we have to use reason to uncover their meaning. Hence the\nanti-dialecticians don\u2019t have a case. \nThere is a far more serious threat to the proper use of reason in\nreligion, Abelard thinks (Theologia christiana 3.20): \nThose who claim to be dialecticians are usually led more easily to\n[heresy] the more they hold themselves to be well-equipped with\nreasons, and, to that extent more secure, they presume to attack or\ndefend any position the more freely. Their arrogance is so great that\nthey think there isn\u2019t anything that can\u2019t be understood\nand explained by their petty little lines of reasoning. Holding all\nauthorities in contempt, they glory in believing only\nthemselves\u2014for those who accept only what their reason persuades\nthem of, surely answer to themselves alone, as if they had eyes that\nwere unacquainted with darkness.\n \nSuch pseudo-dialecticians take reason to be the final arbiter of all\nclaims, including claims about matters of faith. More exactly, Abelard\ncharges them with holding that (a) everything can be explained by\nhuman reason; (b) we should only accept what reason persuades us of;\n(c) appeals to authority have no rational persuasive force. Real\ndialecticians, he maintains, reject (a)\u2013(c), recognizing that\nhuman reason has limits, and that some important truths may lie\noutside those limits but not beyond belief; which claims about matters\nof faith we should accept depends on both the epistemic reliability of\ntheir sources (the authorities) and their consonance with reason to\nthe extent they can be investigated. \nAbelard\u2019s arguments for rejecting (a)\u2013(c) are\nsophisticated and subtle. For the claim that reason may be fruitfully\napplied to a particular article of faith, Abelard offers a particular\ncase study in his own writings. The bulk of Abelard\u2019s work on\ntheology is devoted to his dialectical investigation of the Trinity.\nHe elaborates an original theory of identity to address issues\nsurrounding the Trinity, one that has wider applicability in\nmetaphysics. The upshot of his enquiries is that belief in the Trinity\nis rationally justifiable since as far as reason can take us we find\nthat the doctrine makes sense\u2014at least, once the tools of\ndialectic have been properly employed. \nThe traditional account of identity, derived from Boethius, holds that\nthings may be either generically, specifically, or numerically the\nsame or different. Abelard accepts this account but finds it not\nsufficiently fine-grained to deal with the Trinity. The core of his\ntheory of identity, as presented in his Theologia christiana,\nconsists in four additional modes of identity: (1) essential sameness\nand difference; (2) numerical sameness and difference, which Abelard\nties closely to essential sameness and difference, allowing a more\nfine-grained distinction than Boethius could allow; (3) sameness and\ndifference in definition; (4) sameness and difference in property\n(in proprietate). Roughly, Abelard\u2019s account of\nessential and numerical sameness is intended to improve upon the\nidentity-conditions for things in the world given by the traditional\naccount; his account of sameness in definition is meant to supply\nidentity-conditions for the features of things; and his account of\nsameness in property opens up the possibility of there being different\nidentity-conditions for a single thing having several distinct\nfeatures. \nAbelard holds that two things are the same in essence when\nthey are numerically the same concrete thing (essentia), and\nessentially different otherwise. The Morning Star is essentially the\nsame as the Evening Star, for instance, since each is the selfsame\nplanet Venus. Again, the formal elements that constitute a concrete\nthing are essentially the same as one another and essentially the same\nas the concrete thing of which they are the formal constituents:\nSocrates is his essence (Socrates is what it is to be Socrates). The\ncorresponding general thesis does not hold for parts, however. Abelard\nmaintains that the part is essentially different from the integral\nwhole of which it is a part, reasoning that a given part is completely\ncontained, along with other parts, in the whole, and so is less than\nthe quantity of the whole. \nNumerical difference does not map precisely onto essential difference.\nThe failure of numerical sameness may be due to one of two causes.\nFirst, objects are not numerically the same when one has a part that\nthe other does not have, in which case the objects are essentially\ndifferent as well. Second, objects are numerically different when\nneither has a part belonging to the other. Numerical difference thus\nentails the failure of numerical sameness, but not conversely: a part\nis not numerically the same as its whole, but it is not numerically\ndifferent from its whole. Thus one thing is essentially different from\nanother when either they have only a part in common, in which case\nthey are not numerically the same; or they have no parts in common, in\nwhich case they are numerically different as well as not numerically\nthe same. Since things may be neither numerically the same nor\nnumerically different, the question \u201cHow many things are\nthere?\u201d is ill-formed as it stands and must be made more\nprecise, a fact Abelard exploits in his discussion of the Trinity. \nEssential and numerical sameness and difference apply directly to\nthings in the world; they are extensional forms of identity. By\ncontrast, sameness and difference in definition is roughly analogous\nto modern theories of the identity of properties. Abelard holds that\nthings are the same in definition when what it is to be one\nrequires that it be the other, and conversely; otherwise they differ\nin definition. \nFinally, things are the same in property when they specify\nfeatures that characterize one another. Abelard offers an example to\nclarify this notion. A cube of marble exemplifies both whiteness and\nhardness; what is white is essentially the same as what is hard, since\nthey are numerically the same concrete thing, namely the marble cube;\nyet the whiteness and the hardness in the marble cube clearly differ\nin definition\u2014but even so, what is white is characterized by\nhardness (the white thing is hard), and conversely what is hard is\ncharacterized by whiteness (the hard thing is white). The properties\nof whiteness and hardness are \u201cmixed\u201d since, despite their\nbeing different in definition, each applies to the selfsame concrete\nthing (namely the marble cube) as such and also as it is characterized\nby the other. \nThe interesting case is where something has properties that\n\u201cremain so completely unmixed\u201d that the items they\ncharacterize are different in property. Consider a\nform-matter composite in relation to its matter. The matter out of\nwhich a form-matter composite is made is essentially the same as the\ncomposite, since each is the entire material composite itself. Yet\ndespite their essential sameness, they are not identical; the matter\nis not the composite, nor conversely. The matter is not the composite,\nfor the composite comes to be out of the matter, but the matter does\nnot come to be out of itself. The composite is not the matter, since\n\u201cnothing is in any way a constitutive part of or naturally prior\nto itself.\u201d Instead, the matter is prior to the composite since\nit has the property priority with respect to the composite,\nwhereas the composite is posterior to its matter since it has the\nproperty posteriority with respect to its matter. Now despite\nbeing essentially the same, the matter is not characterized by\nposteriority, unlike the composite, and the composite is not\ncharacterized by priority, unlike the matter. Hence the matter and\ncomposite are different in property; the properties priority\nand posteriority are unmixed\u2014they differ in\nproperty. \nNow for the payoff. Abelard deploys his theory of identity to shed\nlight on the Trinity as follows. The three Persons are essentially the\nsame as one another, since they are all the same concrete thing\n(namely God). They differ from one another in definition, since what\nit is to be the Father is not the same as what it is to be the Son or\nwhat it is to be the Holy Spirit. The three Persons are numerically\ndifferent from one another, for otherwise they would not be three, but\nthey are not numerically different from God: if they were there would\nbe three gods, not one. Moreover, each Person has properties that\nuniquely apply to it\u2014unbegotten to the Father,\nbegotten to the Son, and proceeding to the Holy\nSpirit\u2014as well as properties that are distinctive of it, such as\npower for the Father, wisdom for the Son, and\ngoodness for the Holy Spirit. The unique properties are\nunmixed in Abelard\u2019s technical sense, for the Persons differ\nfrom one another in their unique properties, and such properties do\nnot apply to God; the distinctive properties are mixed, though, in\nthat God is characterized by each (the powerful God is the wise God is\nthe good God).

The Sanskrit term\nabhidharma seems to derive from the expression\n\u201cconcerning (abhi) the teaching(s) (Skt.,\ndharma, Pali, dhamma).\u201d For the Buddhist\nexegetical tradition, however, the term means approximately\n\u201chigher\u201d or \u201cfurther\u201d teaching, and it refers\nboth to the doctrinal investigations of the new scholastic movement\nand to the body of texts yielded by its systematic exposition of\nBuddhist thought. This body of literature includes the third of the\n\u201cthree baskets\u201d (Skt., tripi\u1e6daka, Pali,\ntipi\u1e6daka) of the Buddhist canon, namely, the\nAbhidharma-pi\u1e6daka (Pali,\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka), its commentaries, and later\nexegetical texts. \nBoth as an independent literary genre and a branch of thought and\ninquiry, Abhidharma is to be contrasted with S\u016btr\u0101nta, the\nsystem of the Buddha\u2019s discourses (Skt., s\u016btras,\nPali, suttas). Unlike the earlier Buddhist discourses that\nare colloquial in nature, the Abhidharma method presents the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings in technical terms that are carefully defined\nto ensure analytical exactitude. In content, Abhidharma is distinctive\nin its efforts to provide the theoretical counterpart to the Buddhist\npractice of meditation and, more broadly, a systematic account of\nsentient experience. It does so by analyzing conscious\nexperience\u2014and in this sense one\u2019s\n\u201cworld\u201d\u2014into its constituent mental and physical\nevents (Skt., dharm\u0101, Pali, dhamm\u0101,\nhereafter dharmas\/dhammas respectively). The overarching\ninquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple\ncategories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of\ntheir manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as\nthe \u201cdharma theory.\u201d The exhaustive\ninvestigations into the nature and interaction of dharmas\nextended into the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology,\nand generated doctrinal controversies among different Buddhist\nschools. The Abhidharma analysis of and methods of argumentation about\nthese controversies provided the framework of reference and defined\nthe agenda for the Mah\u0101y\u0101na schools of Madhyamaka and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. As a distinct doctrinal movement, then, Abhidharma\nhad a remarkable impact on subsequent Buddhist thought and gave rise\nto Buddhist systematic philosophy and hermeneutics. \nThe early history of Buddhism in India is remarkably little known and\nthe attempt to construct a consistent chronology of that history still\nengrosses the minds of contemporary scholars. A generally accepted\ntradition has it that some time around the beginning of the third\ncentury BCE, the primitive Buddhist community divided into two parties\nor fraternities: the Sthaviras (Pali, Theriyas) and the\nMah\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ghikas, each of which thenceforth had its own\nordination traditions. Throughout the subsequent two centuries or so,\ndoctrinal disputes arose between these two parties, resulting in the\nformation of various schools of thought (v\u0101da;\n\u0101cariyav\u0101da) and teacher lineages\n(\u0101cariyakula) (Vin 51\u201354; Mhv V\n12\u201313. See Cousins 1991, 27\u201328; Frauwallner 1956, 5ff\n& 130ff; Lamotte 1988, 271ff; Wynne 2019, 269\u2013283). \nAccording to traditional Buddhist accounts, by the time the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na doctrines arose, roughly in the first century BCE,\nthere were eighteen sub-sects or schools of Sthaviras, the tradition\nancestral to the Therav\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine of\nthe elders\u201d). The number eighteen, though, became conventional\nin Buddhist historiography for symbolic and mnemonic reasons\n(Obeyesekere 1991) and, in fact, different Buddhist sources preserve\ndivergent lists of schools which sum up to more than eighteen. The\nlikelihood is that the early formative period of the Buddhist\ncommunity gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed\nspontaneously due to the geographical extension of the community over\nthe entire Indian subcontinent and subject to the particular problems\nthat confronted each monastic community (sa\u1e45gha). Each\nsa\u1e45gha tended to specialize in a specific branch of\nlearning, had its own practical customs and relations with lay\ncircles, and was influenced by the particular territories, economy,\nand use of language and dialect prevalent in its environment. Indeed,\nthe names of the \u201ceighteen schools\u201d are indicative of\ntheir origins in characteristic doctrines, geographical locations, or\nthe legacy of particular founders: for instance,\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that all\nthings exist\u201d), Sautr\u0101ntikas (\u201cthose who rely on the\ns\u016btras\u201d)\/D\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ntikas\n(\u201cthose who employ\n examples\u201d),[1]\n and Pudgalav\u0101da (\u201cthose who affirm the existence of the\nperson\u201d); Haimavatas (\u201cthose of the snowy\nmountains\u201d); or V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas (\u201cthose\naffiliated with V\u0101ts\u012bputra\u201d) respectively. As noted by\nGethin (1998, 52), rather than sects or denominations as in\nChristianity, \u201cat least some of the schools mentioned by later\nBuddhist tradition are likely to have been informal schools of thought\nin the manner of \u2018Cartesians,\u2019 \u2018British\nEmpiricists,\u2019 or \u2018Kantians\u2019 for the history of\nmodern\n philosophy.\u201d[2] \nIt is customarily assumed that the multiple ancient Buddhist schools\ntransmitted their own versions of Abhidharma collections, but only two\ncomplete canonical collections are preserved, representing two\nschools: the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, who emerged as an independent\nschool from within the Sthaviras around the second or first century\nBCE, became dominant in north, especially northwest India, and spread\nto central Asia; and the Sinhalese Therav\u0101da, a branch of the\nSthaviras that spread out in south India and parts of southeast Asia.\nThese two extant collections comprise the third of the \u201cthree\nbaskets\u201d (Skt., tripi\u1e6daka, Pali,\ntipi\u1e6daka) of the Buddhist canon. The exegetical\ntraditions of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da understand\ntheir respective canonical Abhidharma to consist of a set of seven\ntexts, though each school specifies a different set of texts. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din Abhidharma-pi\u1e6daka consists of\nthe Sa\u1e45g\u012btipary\u0101ya (Discourse on the\nCollective Recitation), the Dharmaskandha\n(Compendium of Dharmas), the\nPraj\u00f1apti\u015b\u0101stra (Manual of\nConcepts), the Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya\n(Compendium of Consciousness), the\nDh\u0101tuk\u0101ya (Compendium of Elements), the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da (Literary\nExposition), and the J\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na\n(The Foundation of Knowledge). These seven texts survive in\nfull only in their ancient Chinese translations. The Therav\u0101din\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka comprises the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i (Enumeration of\nDhammas), the Vibha\u1e45ga (Analysis),\nthe Dh\u0101tukath\u0101 (Discourse on Elements),\nthe Puggalapa\u00f1\u00f1atti (Designation of\nPersons), the Kath\u0101vatthu (Points of\nDiscussion), the Yamaka (Pairs), and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Causal Conditions). These\nseven texts are preserved in Pali and all but the Yamaka have\nbeen translated into English. \nLater generations composed commentaries on the canonical Abhidharma\nand introduced a variety of exegetical manuals that expound the\nessentials of the canonical systems. These post-canonical texts are\nthe products of single authors and display fully developed polemical\nstances and sectarian worldviews of their respective schools. Much of\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma system is contained in\nBuddhaghosa\u2019s comprehensive Visuddhimagga (The Path\nof Purification, fifth century CE). More direct introductory\nAbhidhamma manuals are Buddhadatta\u2019s\nAbhidhamm\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction to\nAbhidhamma, fifth century CE) and Anuruddha\u2019s\nAbhidhammatthasa\u1e45gaha (Compendium of the Topics of\nAbhidhamma, twelfth century CE). The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\ntradition preserves in Chinese translation three different recensions\nof an authoritative Abhidharma commentary or\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 dated to the first or second century\nCE, the last and best known of which is called the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101. The\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia document several centuries\nof scholarly activity representing multiple Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nbranches, most notably the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins of Kashmir who are\nknown as Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da manual most influential for later Chinese and\nTibetan Buddhism, however, is Vasubandhu\u2019s\nAbhidharmako\u015ba (Treasury of Abhidharma, fifth\ncentury CE). The Abhidharmako\u015ba\u2019s auto-commentary\ncontains substantial criticism of orthodox Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\npositions, which later Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nmasters attempted to refute. Particularly famous in this category is\nthe Ny\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra (Conformance to Correct\nPrinciple) of Sa\u1e45ghabhadra, a contemporary of Vasubandhu.\nThis comprehensive treatise reestablishes orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da views and is considered one of the final\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da works to have\n survived.[3] \nIn sum, the Abhidharma\/Abhidhamma texts are by and large compositions\ncontemporary with the formative period in the history of the early\nBuddhist schools, providing the means by which one group could define\nitself and defend its position against the divergent interpretations\nand criticisms of other parties. Although much of the Abhidharma\nmindset and something of its method draw on the\n\u0100gamas\/Nik\u0101yas, i.e., the collections of\ns\u016btras (Pali, suttas), the main body of its\nliterature contains interpretations of the Buddha\u2019s discourses\nspecific to each school of thought and philosophical elaborations of\nselectively emphasized doctrinal issues. These continued to be refined\nby subsequent generations of monks who contributed to the\nconsolidation of the two surviving Therav\u0101da and\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da schools. \nThe Abhidharma attempts to individuate and determine the unique\nidentity of each dharma yield complex intersecting taxonomies\nof dharmas organized by multiple criteria or sets of\nqualities. Abhidharma texts of different schools proposed different\ndharma taxonomies, enumerating a more or less finite number\nof dharma categories. It is important to remember, though,\nthat the term dharma signifies both any category that\nrepresents a type of occurrence as well as any of its particular\ntokens or instances. The Therav\u0101da introduced a system of\neighty-two dhamma categories, meaning that there are\neighty-two possible types of occurrence in the experiential world, not\neighty-two occurrences. These are organized into a fourfold\ncategorization. The first three categories include the bare phenomenon\nof consciousness (citta) that encompasses a single\ndhamma type and of which the essential characteristic is the\ncognizing of an object; associated mentality (cetasika) that\nencompasses fifty-two dhammas; and materiality or physical\nphenomena (r\u016bpa) that include twenty-eight\ndhammas that make up all physical occurrences\n(Abhidh-av 1). All the eighty-one dhamma types in\nthese three broad categories are conditioned\n(sa\u1e45khata). Conditioned dhammas arise and\ncease subject to numerous causes and conditions and constitute\nsentient experience in all realms of the round of rebirth\n (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra).[8]\n The eighty-second dhamma that comprises the fourth category\nis unconditioned (asa\u1e45khata): it neither arises nor\nceases through causal interaction. The single occurrence in this\nfourth category is nirvana (Pali, nibb\u0101na). \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da adopted a system of seventy-five basic\ntypes of dharmas organized into a fivefold categorization.\nThe first four categories comprise all conditioned\n(sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta) dharmas and include, again,\nconsciousness (citta, one single dharma); associated\nmentality (caitta, encompasses forty-six dharmas);\nand physical phenomena (r\u016bpa, eleven dharmas);\nbut also factors dissociated from thought\n(cittaviprayuktasa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, fourteen\ndharmas). The last category is mentioned neither in the\ns\u016btras nor in the Therav\u0101da lists, but is found\npredominantly in northern Indian Abhidharma texts of all periods. The\nspecific dharmas included within it vary, but they are all\nunderstood as explaining a range of experiential events, being\nthemselves dissociated from both material form and thought. The fifth\ncategory in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da taxonomy, that of the\nunconditioned (asa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta), comprises three\ndharmas, namely, space and two states of cessation\n(nirodha), the latter being a term that connotes the\nculmination of the Buddhist path (Cox 1995; 2004A, 553\u2013554). \nThe Abhidharma analyzes in great detail each of these categories, thus\ncreating relational schemata whereby each acknowledged experience,\nphenomenon, or occurrence can be determined and identified by\nparticular definition and function. Especially important is the\nanalysis of consciousness or citta, on which much of\nAbhidharma doctrinal thought is built. Consider the Therav\u0101da\nanalysis of consciousness, whose basic principles are shared with the\nother Abhidharma systems. \nThe epitome of the operation of consciousness is citta as\nexperienced in the process of sensory perception that, in Abhidharma\n(as in Buddhism in general), is deemed the paradigm of sentient\nexperience. Citta can never be experienced as bare\nconsciousness in its own origination moment, for consciousness is\nalways intentional, directed to a particular object that is cognized\nby means of certain mental factors. Citta, therefore, always\noccurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental\nfactors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease\ntogether with it, having the same object (either sensuous or mental)\nand grounded in the same sense faculty. Any given consciousness\nmoment\u2014also signified by the very term citta\u2014is\nthus a unique assemblage of citta and its associated mental\nfactors such as feeling, conceptualization, volition, or attention, to\nname several of those required in any thought process. Each assemblage\nis conscious of just one object, arises for a brief instant and then\nfalls away, followed by another citta combination that picks\nup a different object by means of its particular associated mental\nfactors. \nThe classic Abhidhamma scheme as gleaned from the first book of the\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka, the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, and as organized by the\ncommentarial tradition describes eighty-nine basic types of\nconsciousness moments, i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncetasika (Dhs Book I; Vism XIV\n81\u2013110; Abhidh-av 1\u201315; Abhidh-s\n1\u20135). It classifies these basic citta types most\nbroadly according to their locus of occurrence, beginning with the\nsense-sphere (k\u0101m\u0101vacara) that includes forty-five\ncitta types, most prominently those that concern the\nmechanics of perception of sensuous objects; next come eighteen\nform-sphere (r\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that\nconcern the mind that has attained meditative absorption\n(jh\u0101na); followed by eight formless-sphere\n(ar\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that constitute the\nmind that has reached further meditative attainments known as formless\nstates; finally, there are eighteen world-transcending\n(lokuttara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind at the\nmoment of awakening itself: these have nirvana as their object. Within\nthese four broad categories many other classifications operate. For\ninstance, some dhammas are wholesome, others unwholesome;\nsome are resultant, others are not; some are motivated, others are\nwithout motivations. These attribute matrices, writes Cox (2004A,\n552), form \u201can abstract web of all possible conditions and\ncharacteristics exhibited by actually occurring dharmas. The\nindividual character of any particular dharma can then be\nspecified in accordance with every taxonomic possibility, resulting in\na complete assessment of that dharma\u2019s range of\npossible occurrences.\u201d \nVarious scholars have argued that this system reflects a dynamic\nconception of dharmas: that Abhidharma understands\ndharmas as properties, activities, or patterns of\ninterconnection that construct one\u2019s world, not as static\nsubstances (e.g., Cox 2004A, 549ff; Gethin 1992A, 149\u2013150;\nKarunadasa 2010, Ch. 4; Nyanaponika 1998, Ch. 2 & 4; Ronkin 2005,\nCh. 4; Waldron 2002, 2\u201316). The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are\n\u201cexplicitly open\u201d and reflect \u201ca certain reluctance\nand hesitancy to say categorically that such and such is the\ndefinitive list of dharmas\u201d (Gethin 2017, 252), leaving room for\ncontinued debates about what is and is not a dharma. For the\nAbhidharma, as for Buddhism in general, the limits of one\u2019s\nworld are set by the limits of one\u2019s lived experience, and the\ncausal foundation for lived experience is the operation of one\u2019s\ncognitive apparatus. According to the Buddhist path, the nature of\nlived experience as based on one\u2019s cognitive apparatus is to be\ncontemplated by investigating the very nature of one\u2019s mind\nthrough the practice of meditation. From this perspective, Abhidharma\nrepresents the theoretical counterpart to the practice of meditation.\nWithin this context of Buddhist practice, dharmas are\ndistinct (but interrelated) functions, energies, or causally\nsignificant aspects\u2014in this sense\n\u201ccomponents\u201d\u2014of consciousness moments. \nThe categorial analysis of dharmas is therefore a meditative\npractice of discernment of dharmas: it is not intended as a\nclosed inventory of all existing dharmas \u201cout\nthere\u201d in their totality, but rather \u201chas a dual\nsoteriological purpose involving two simultaneous processes\u201d\n(Cox 2004A, 551). First, as \u201cevaluative\u201d analysis, the\ndharma typology maps out the constituents and workings of the\nmind and accounts for what makes up ordinary wholesome consciousness\nas opposed to the awakened mind. For instance, consciousness types\nthat arise in a mind that has attained meditative absorption become\nincreasingly refined and may never involve certain tendencies or\ndefilements that might potentially occur in ordinary (even wholesome)\nconsciousness. To watch dharmas as dharmas, writes\nGethin (2004, 536), \u201cinvolves watching how they arise and\ndisappear, how the particular qualities that one wants to abandon can\nbe abandoned, and how the particular qualities that one wants to\ndevelop can be developed. Watching dhammas in this way one\nbegins to understand [\u2026] certain truths\n(sacca)\u2014four to be exact\u2014about these\ndhammas: their relation to suffering, its arising, its\nceasing and the way to its ceasing. And in seeing these four truths\none realizes the ultimate truth\u2014dhamma\u2014about the\n world.\u201d[9] \nThe second, \u201cdescriptive\u201d soteriological process involved\nin the categorization of dharmas reveals the fluid nature of\nsentient experience and validates the fundamental Buddhist teaching of\nnot-self (Skt., an\u0101tman, Pali, anatta). The\nincreasingly detailed enumerations of dharmas demonstrate\nthat no essence or independent self could be found in any phenomenon\nor its constituents, since all aspects of experience are impermanent,\narising and passing away subject to numerous causes and conditions.\nEven the handful dharmas that are categorized as\nunconditioned (that is, having no cause and no effect) are shown to be\nnot-self. The practice of the discrimination of dharmas thus\nundermines the apparently solid world we emotionally and\nintellectually grasp at that is replete with objects of desire and\nattachment. \u201cTry to grasp the world of the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, or the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na,\u201d Gethin notes (1992B, 165),\n\u201cand it runs through one\u2019s fingers.\u201d \nNevertheless, the very notion of the plurality of dharmas as\nthe building blocks or the final units of analysis of sentient\nexperience signifies a considerable shift in the Buddhist\nunderstanding of dharma. Abhidharma thought was gradually\ndrawn into espousing a naturalistic explanation of dharmas as\nthe fundamental constituents of the phenomenal world, increasingly\nassociating dharmas as primary existents. The category of the\nunconditioned within the dharma taxonomy also asserted the\npossibility of enduring or permanent dharmas, in contrast to\nall other dharmas that arise and cease through causal\ninteraction. The Abhidharma exegesis, then, occasioned among Buddhist\ncircles doctrinal controversies that could be termed ontological\naround such issues as what the nature of a dharma is; what,\nin the internal constitution of a dharma, makes it the very\nparticular it is; the manner of existence of dharmas; the\ndynamics of their causal interaction; and the nature of the reality\nthey constitute. The distinctive principles and their ensuing\nontological interpretations constructed by the Buddhist schools were\nlargely shaped by a radical construal of impermanence as\nmomentariness. \nBoth the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the post-canonical Therav\u0101da\nconstructed a radical doctrine of momentariness (Skt.,\nk\u1e63\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da, Pali,\nkh\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da) that atomizes phenomena temporally\nby dissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events\nthat pass out of existence as soon as they have originated. Albeit not\na topic in its own right in the Buddha\u2019s discourses, the\ndoctrine of momentariness appears to have originated in conjunction\nwith the principle of impermanence (Skt., anitya, Pali,\nanicca). This idea is basic to the Buddha\u2019s\nempirically-oriented teaching about the nature of sentient experience:\nall physical and mental phenomena are in a constant process of\nconditioned construction and are interconnected, being dependently\noriginated (e.g., A I 286; M I 230, 336, 500;\nS II 26, III 24\u20135, 96\u20139, IV 214). The Suttanta\nelaboration on these three interlocking ideas results in a formula\n(A I 152) that states that conditioned phenomena (Skt.,\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101r\u0101, Pali,\nsa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101) are of the nature of origination\n(upp\u0101da), \u201cchange of what endures\u201d\n(\u1e6dhitassa a\u00f1\u00f1athatta), and dissolution or\ncessation (vaya). This formula is known as the \u201cthree\ncharacteristics of what is conditioned\u201d\n(tisa\u1e45khatalakkha\u1e47a). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika introduced four\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena: origination, endurance,\ndecay, and dissolution. These are classified under the dharma\ncategory of \u201cfactors dissociated from thought.\u201d \nThe Buddhist schools used the characteristics of conditioned phenomena\nas a hermeneutic tool with which to reinterpret impermanence in terms\nof momentariness. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nproposed a fully-fledged doctrine of momentariness according to which\nall physical and mental phenomena are momentary. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins use the term \u201cmoment\u201d\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47a) in a highly technical sense as the\nsmallest, definite unit of time that cannot be subdivided, the length\nof which came to be equated with the duration of mental events as the\nbriefest conceivable entities. There is no Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din\nconsensus on the length of a moment, but the texts indicate figures\nbetween 0.13 and 13 milliseconds in modern terms (Gethin 1998, 221;\nvon Rospatt 1995, 94\u2013110). This usage presupposes an atomistic\nconception of time, for time is not reckoned indefinitely divisible.\nIndeed, the term k\u1e63a\u1e47a is often discussed in\njuxtaposition to the concepts of material atoms and syllables, which\nare likewise comprehended as indivisible. \nWithin the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, material reality\n(r\u016bpa-dharma) is reduced to discrete momentary atoms,\nand much attention is drawn to ontological and epistemological\nquestions such as whether sense objects are real at any time, or\nwhether atoms contribute separately or collectively to the generation\nof perception. Atomic reality is understood as constantly changing:\nwhat appears to us as a world made up of enduring substances with\nchanging qualities is, in fact, a series of moments that arise and\nperish in rapid succession. This process is not random, but operates\nin accordance with the specific capability and function of each atom.\nThe spirit of this atomistic analysis of material reality applies\nequally to mental reality: consciousness is understood as a succession\nof discrete consciousness moments that arise and cease extremely\n rapidly.[10]\n Thus, the ratio of change between material and mental phenomena in\nany given moment is one to one: they occur in perfect synchronicity\n(Kim 1999, 54). On this point the Sautr\u0101ntika agreed with the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da. \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that\nall things exist\u201d) were unique in their stance that the\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena exist separately as real\nentities within each moment. Their claim, then, is that all\nconditioned dharmas\u2014whether past, present, or\nfuture\u2014exist as real entities (dravyatas) within the\nspan of any given moment. This induced a host of problems, one of\nwhich is that the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da definition of a moment is\ndifficult to reconcile with its conception as the shortest unit of\ntime (von Rospatt 1995, 44\u201346 & 97\u201398). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da replies to this criticism by stating that the\nactivities (k\u0101ritra) of the four characteristics of\nconditioned phenomena are sequential: the limits between the birth and\ndissolution of any event are referred to as one moment. This solution,\nhowever, implies that a single event undergoes four phases within a\ngiven moment, which inevitably infringes upon its momentariness (Cox\n1995, 151; von Rospatt 1995, 52ff). \nThe Therav\u0101dins created their own distinct version of the\ndoctrine of momentariness. They do not seem to have been as concerned\nas the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins with the ontology and epistemology of\nmaterial and mental realities per se. Rather, they were more\npreoccupied with the psychological apparatus governing the process of\ncognizing of sense data, and hence with the changing ratio between\nmaterial and mental phenomena. The Yamaka of the canonical\nAbhidhamma offers what is probably the first textual occurrence of the\nterm \u201cmoment\u201d (kha\u1e47a) in the sense of a\nvery brief stretch of time that is divided into origination and\ncessation instants (Kim 1999, 60\u201361). Relying on the three\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena, the Pali commentaries later\npresent a scheme wherein each moment of every phenomenon is subdivided\ninto three different instants of origination\n(upp\u0101dakkha\u1e47a), endurance\n(\u1e6dhitikkha\u1e47a) and cessation\n(bha\u1e45gakkha\u1e47a) (Spk II 266;\nMp II 252). These are three phases of a single momentary\nphenomenon defined as one single dhamma or consciousness\nmoment. A dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second, and ceases in the third (Karunadasa 2010, 234ff). The\ncommentarial tradition thus analyzes phenomena temporally by\ndissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events that\nfall away as soon as they have originated in consciousness. As one\nevent is exhausted, it conditions a new event of its kind that\nproceeds immediately afterwards. The result is an uninterrupted,\nflowing continuum (sant\u0101na) of causally connected\nmomentary events. These succeed each other so fast that we conceive of\nthe phenomena they constitute as temporally extended. \nThe Therav\u0101dins use the term kha\u1e47a as the\nexpression for a brief instant, the dimension of which is not fixed\nbut may be determined by the context. For example,\ncittakkha\u1e47a refers to the instant taken by one\nmental event. In this basic sense as denoting a very brief stretch of\ntime, the term \u201cmoment\u201d does not entail an atomistic\nconception of a definite and ultimate, smallest unit of time, but\nleaves open the possibility that time is infinitely divisible (von\nRospatt 1995, 59\u201360 & 94\u201395). Here the three moments\nof origination, endurance, and cessation do not correspond to three\ndifferent entities. Rather, they represent three phases of a single\nmomentary phenomenon and are defined as one single consciousness\nmoment: a dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second sub-moment and perishes in the third one. In this way, the\nTherav\u0101dins avoided some of the difficulties faced by the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, of how to compress the\ncharacteristics of the conditioned into one single indivisible moment\nand of how to account for their ontological status. The\nTherav\u0101dins also claimed that only mental phenomena are\nmomentary, whereas material phenomena (e.g., common-sense objects)\nendure for a stretch of time. The Therav\u0101din commentarial\ntradition subsequently elaborated on this proposition and produced a\nunique view of the ratio between material and mental phenomena,\nasserting that a material phenomenon lasts for sixteen or seventeen\nconsciousness moments (Kv 620; Vibh-a 25\u201328;\nVism XX 24\u201326; Kim 1999, 79\u201380 &\n\u00a73.1). \nDespite their different interpretations of the concept of\nmomentariness, the early Buddhist schools all derived this concept\nfrom the analysis of impermanence in terms of the dynamics of\ndharmas qua physical and mental events. The equation of a\nmoment with the duration of these transient events as extremely short\noccurrences\u2014even the shortest conceivable\u2014led to the\ndirect determination of the moment in terms of these occurrences. Yet\nthe doctrine of momentariness spawned a host of problems for the\nBuddhist schools, particularly with regard to the status of the\nendurance moment and to the explanation of continuity and conditioning\ninteraction among the dharmas (see section 5 below). If\ndharmas go through an endurance phase or exist as real\nentities within the span of any given moment, how can they be\nmomentary? And if experience is an array of strictly momentary\ndharmas, how can continuity and causal conditioning be\npossible? \nOne might argue that the conceptual shift from\n\u201cimpermanence\u201d to \u201cendurance\u201d is a result of\nscholastic literalism and testifies to the Abhidharma tendency towards\nreification and hypostatization of dharmas (Gombrich 1996,\n36\u201337, 96\u201397 & 106\u2013107). Nevertheless, the\nobject of the doctrine of momentariness is not so much existence in\ntime or the passage of time per se, but rather, in epistemological\nterms and a somewhat Bergsonian sense, the construction of temporal\nexperience. Instead of a transcendental matrix of order imposed on\nnatural events from without, time is seen as an inherent feature of\nthe operation of dharmas. The doctrine of momentariness\nanalyzes dharmas as they transpire through time: as\npsycho-physical events that arise and cease in consciousness and, by\nthe dynamics of their rise and fall, construct time. The sequence of\nthe three times is therefore secondary, generated in and by the\nprocess of conditioned and conditioning dharmas. In fact, the\nconceptual shift from the principle of impermanence to the theory of\nmomentariness is a shift in time scales. While the S\u016btr\u0101nta\nworldview interprets the three times as referring to past, present,\nand future lives, the Abhidharma sees them as phases that any\nconditioned dharma undergoes each and every moment.\nImpermanence marks dharmas over a period of time, but is also\nencapsulated in every single consciousness moment (Vibh-a\n7\u20138; Sv 991; Vism XIV 191; Collins 1992, 227). \nTo preserve the principle of impermanence and explain continuity and\ncausal conditioning in ordinary experience, the Buddhist schools\nintroduced novel interpretations of the nature of dharmas. At\nthe heart of these interpretations is the concept of intrinsic nature\n(Skt., svabh\u0101va, Pali, sabh\u0101va) that plays\na major role in the systematization of Abhidharma thought, is closely\nrelated to the consolidation of the dharma theory, and is\nregarded as that which gave an impetus to the Abhidharma growing\nconcern with ontology. \nThe term svabh\u0101va\/sabh\u0101va does not feature in the\ns\u016btras\/suttas and its rare mentions in other\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da canonical texts offer no\naccount of dharma as defined by a fixed intrinsic nature that\nverifies its real\n existence.[11]\n This situation changes significantly in the post-canonical\nliterature, in which svabh\u0101va becomes a standard concept\nextensively used in dharma exegesis. A recurring idea in the\nexegetical Abhidharma literature from the period of the early\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward is that\ndharmas are defined by virtue of their\nsvabh\u0101va. For instance, a definition transmitted in the\nAbhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya reads:\n\u201cdharma means \u2018upholding,\u2019 [namely],\nupholding intrinsic nature (svabh\u0101va),\u201d and the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 states that \u201cintrinsic\nnature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it [\u2026]\nas in the case of unconditioned dharmas that are able to\nuphold their own identity\u201d (Cox 2004A, 558\u2013559).\nSimilarly, a definition prevalent in Therav\u0101din Abhidhamma\ncommentaries is: \u201cdhammas are so called because they\nbear their intrinsic natures, or because they are borne by causal\nconditions\u201d (e.g., Dhs-a 39-40; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 18; Vism-mh\u1e6d I 347). The commentaries also regularly\nequate dhammas with their intrinsic natures, using the terms\ndhamma and sabh\u0101va interchangeably. For\nexample, the Visuddhimagga proclaims that\n\u201cdhamma means but intrinsic nature\u201d\n(Vism VIII 246), and the sub-commentary to the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i indicates that \u201cthere is no\nother thing called dhamma apart from the intrinsic nature\nborne by it\u201d and that \u201cthe term sabh\u0101va\ndenotes the mere fact of being a dhamma\u201d\n(Dhs-m\u1e6d 28 & 94; see also Karunadasa 2010: Ch.\n1). \nThese commentarial definitions of dharmas as carrying their\nintrinsic natures should not be interpreted ontologically as implying\nthat dharmas are substances having inherent existence. The\nPali commentaries, cautions Gethin (2004, 533), \u201care often\nviewed too much in the light of later controversies about the precise\nontological status of dharmas and the Madhyamaka critique of\nthe notion of svabh\u0101va in the sense of \u2018inherent\nexistence.\u2019\u201d In fact, defining dharmas as bearing\ntheir intrinsic natures conveys the idea that there is no enduring\nagent behind them. Adding that dharmas are borne by causal\nconditions counters the idea of intrinsic natures borne by underlying\nsubstances distinct from themselves. Just as dharmas are\npsycho-physical events that occur dependently on appropriate\nconditions and qualities, their intrinsic natures arise dependently on\nother conditions and qualities rather than on a substratum more real\nthan they are (ibid; Karunadasa 1996, 13\u201316;\nNyanaponika 1998, 40\u201341). \nWe must also note that the context within which dharmas are\nrendered in terms of their intrinsic natures is that of\ncategorization, where multiple criteria and qualities are applied to\ncreate a comprehensive taxonomic system that distinguishes the\nparticular character of any given dharma. Cox (2004A:\n559\u2013561) has shown that in the early period of northern Indian\nAbhidharma texts, as represented by the\n\u015a\u0101riputr\u0101bhidharma\u015b\u0101stra and\nportions of the Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, the concept\nof intrinsic nature develops within the context of the method of\ninclusion (sa\u1e43graha), that is, the process by which the\ninclusion of dharmas within a specific category is to be\napplied. Dharmas are determined (parini\u1e63panna)\nby the intrinsic nature that defines them and hence should not be\nconsidered to possess a separately existing intrinsic nature.\n\u201c\u2018Determination\u2019 implies two further features of\ndharmas [\u2026] First, just as categories in a\nwell-structured taxonomic schema are distinct and not subject to\nfluctuation, so also dharmas, as \u2018determined,\u2019\nare clearly and unalterably discriminated: they are uniquely\nindividualized and as such are not subject to confusion with other\ndharmas. [Second,] determination by intrinsic nature\nundergoes no variation or modification, and hence, dharmas,\nwhich are in effect types or categories of intrinsic nature, are\nestablished as stable and immutable\u201d (ibid, 562). In\nthe early Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegetical texts, then,\nsvabh\u0101va is used as an atemporal, invariable criterion\ndetermining what a dharma is, not necessarily\nthat a dharma exists. The concern here is primarily\nwith what makes categorial types of dharma unique, rather\nthan with the ontological status of dharmas. \nNevertheless, from the foregoing categorial theory, the mature\nAbhidharma drew ontological conclusions with regard to the reality of\ndharmas. This transition in the conception of dharma\ncoincided with an inherent ambiguity in the term\nsvabh\u0101va, which is grounded logically and etymologically\nin the term bh\u0101va that came to denote \u201cmode of\nexistence\u201d (ibid, 565\u2013568). In the\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia and contemporaneous texts,\n\u201cthe explicit emphasis upon categorization per se\nrecedes in importance as the focus shifts to clarifying the character\nand eventually the ontological status of individual dharmas.\nAccordingly, the term svabh\u0101va acquires the dominant\nsense of \u2018intrinsic nature\u2019 specifying individual\ndharmas [\u2026] And determining individual\ndharmas through unique intrinsic nature also entails\naffirming their existence, as a natural function both of the\netymological sense of the term svabh\u0101va and of the role\nof dharmas as the fundamental constituents of experience.\nThis then leads to the prominence of a new term that expressed this\nontological focus: namely, dravya\u201d (ibid,\n569). Dravya means \u201creal existence\u201d and, within\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, dharmas that are\ndetermined by intrinsic nature exist as real entities\n(dravyatas), as opposed both to composite objects of ordinary\nexperience that exist provisionally and to relative concepts or\ncontingencies of time and place that exist relatively. The presence of\nintrinsic nature indicates that a dharma is a primary\nexistent, irrespective of its temporal status, namely, whether it is a\npast, present or future dharma, and hence the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da declaration that \u201call things\nexist.\u201d \nThe Therav\u0101da rejected the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological\nmodel, claiming that dhammas exist only in the present. But\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma shares with the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nthe same principles of dhamma analysis as a categorial theory\nthat individuates sentient experience. Here, too, the taxonomic\nfunction of sabh\u0101va gave rise to ontological\nconnotations of existence in the characterization of dhammas.\nAs the final units of Abhidhamma analysis, dhammas are\nreckoned the ultimate constituents of experience. \u201cThere is\nnothing else, whether a being, or an entity, or a man or a\nperson,\u201d a famous Pali commentarial excerpt proclaims\n(Dhs-a\n 155).[12]\n While this statement is meant to refute the rival Pudgalav\u0101da\nposition of the reality of the person by insisting that there is no\nbeing or person apart from dhammas, there emerges the idea\nthat the phenomenal world is, at bottom, a world of dhammas:\nthat within the confines of sentient experience there is no other\nactuality apart from dhammas and that what constitutes any\ngiven dhamma as a discrete, individualized particular is its\nintrinsic nature. The Therav\u0101da elaborates on the concept of\nsabh\u0101va in juxtaposition to its theory of momentariness,\nand it acquires the sense of what underlies a dhamma\u2019s\nendurance moment and as a point of reference to the moments of\norigination and cessation. Before a dhamma eventuates it does\nnot yet obtain an intrinsic nature and when it ceases it is denuded of\nthis intrinsic nature. As a present occurrence, though, while\npossessing its intrinsic nature, it exists as an ultimate reality and\nits intrinsic nature is evidence of its actual existence as such\n(Dhs-a 45; Vism VIII 234, XV 15). One commentarial\npassage even goes so far as naming this instant \u201cthe acquisition\nof a self\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d I 343). \nThe Abhidharma\u2019s ontological investigations occasioned a host of\ndoctrinal problems that became the subject of an ongoing debate among\nthe Buddhist schools. One primary controversy centered on the\nprinciple of impermanence: if all phenomena are impermanent, the\nSautr\u0101ntika challenged the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the\nTherav\u0101da, then dharmas must be changing continuously\nand can neither exist in the past and future nor endure for any period\nof time, however short, in the present. On the other hand, the\nsystematic analysis of experience in terms of momentary\ndharmas required the Abhidharma to provide a rigorous account\nof the processes that govern psychological and physical continuity.\nWhat fuels these processes is causal interaction, but the very notion\nof causation is allegedly compromised by the theory of momentariness.\nIf causes, conditions, and their results are all momentary events, how\ncan an event that has ended have a result? How can an event that\nundergoes distinct stages of origination, endurance, and cessation in\na brief moment have causal efficacy? Notwithstanding their doctrinal\ndifferences, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the Therav\u0101da\nAbhidhamma had to confront these challenges, and they did so by\nformulating complex theories of immediate contiguity that grant causal\nefficacy. \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da developed an analysis of causal\nconditioning in terms of intricate interrelations among four types of\ncondition (pratyaya) and six types of cause (hetu).\nAs documented in the Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya\n(AKB 2.49) based on canonical texts including the\nVij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya, the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da, and the\nJ\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na, the four conditions are: 1)\nroot cause (literally \u201ccause as condition,\u201d\nhetupratyaya), reckoned the foremost in inciting the process\nof fruition and origination; 2) immediate antecedent, which holds\nbetween a consciousness moment and its immediately preceding moment in\nthat consciousness series; 3) object support, which applies to all\ndharmas insofar as they are intentional objects of\nconsciousness; and 4) predominance, which facilitates sensory\ndiscriminative awareness, e.g., the faculty of sight\u2019s\npredominance over visual cognitive awareness. The six causes are: 1)\ninstrumentality (k\u0101ra\u1e47ahetu), deemed the primary\nfactor in the production of a result; 2) simultaneity or coexistence,\nwhich connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity,\nexplaining the homogenous flow of dharmas that evokes the\nseeming continuity of phenomena; 4) association, which operates only\nbetween mental dharmas and explains why the elements of\nconsciousness always appear as assemblages of mental factors; 5)\ndominance, which forms one\u2019s habitual cognitive and behaviorist\ndispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the result of\nactively wholesome or unwholesome dharmas. The four\nconditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining\nphenomenal experience: for instance, each consciousness moment acts\nboth as the homogenous cause as well as the immediate antecedent\ncondition of the rise of consciousness and its concomitants in a\nsubsequent\n moment.[13] \nUnderlying this analysis of causal conditioning is the notion of\nexistence as efficacious action, or karma. Karma, a fundamental\nprinciple in Buddhist thought from its inception, is what fuels the\nrepetitive experience in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the round of\n rebirth.[14]\n In Abhidharma exegesis, the efficacious action or distinctive\nfunctioning of dharmas is understood predominantly as causal\nfunctioning. For the orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, the existence of\ndharmas as real entities (dravyatas) is determined\nby both their intrinsic nature and particular causal functioning.\nIntrinsic nature, however, is an atemporal determinant of real\nexistence. What determines a dharma\u2019s spatio-temporal\nexistence is its distinctive causal functioning: past and future\ndharmas have capability (s\u0101marthya) of\nfunctioning, while present dharmas also exert a distinctive\nactivity (k\u0101ritra). Present activity is an internal\ncausal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a\ndharma\u2019s own consciousness series. It is this activity\nthat determines a dharma\u2019s present existence and\ndefines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by\ncontrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards\nanother consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists\nanother dharma in the production of its own effect (Cox\n2004A, 570\u2013573; Williams 1981, 240\u2013243). A\ndharma\u2019s present activity arises and falls away, but\npast and future dharmas all have potential for causal\nfunctioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature.\nFor the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, this model\u2014which insists on\nconstant change within the limits of the present moment and implies\nthe existence of dharmas in the three time\nperiods\u2014preserves both the principle of impermanence yet\nexplains continuity and causal efficacy. \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika distinction between a\ndharma\u2019s activity and capability implies that each\ndharma or consciousness moment effects the next moment within\nits series, but it can also act as a contributory condition towards\nproducing a different sort of effect. Activity engenders the next\nmoment within a dharma\u2019s series, while capability\ngenerates a different effect and explains the causal efficacy of past\ndharmas. Williams (1981, 246\u2013247) helpfully notes that\nwe may render this \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d\ncausality, within a consciousness series and transcending it\nrespectively. For example, an instant of visual awareness horizontally\nproduces the next moment of visual awareness and may or may not,\ndepending on other factors such as light and so on, vertically produce\nvision of the object. \u201cIt follows that to be present is to have\nhorizontal causality, which may or may not include vertical\ncausality\u2014a fact which serves to remind us that we are dealing\nhere with primary existents which are frequently positioned within the\nsystem in terms of what they do\u201d (ibid). Thus activity\nor horizontal causality\u2014a dharma\u2019s function of\nprecipitating the next moment of its own consciousness\nseries\u2014individuates that dharma as a particular event\nof its kind. A dharma\u2019s capability or vertical\ncausality, by which it facilitates the occurrence of other\ndharmas outside its consciousness series, locates it within\nthe web of interrelations that connects it with the incessant rise and\nfall of other dharmas, and hence further individuates it as\nthat very particular dharma by manifesting its unique quality\nand intensity of operation. \nThe Satur\u0101ntika and the Therav\u0101da developed alternative\ntheories of causal conditioning in conjunction with their rejection of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological model and their claim that\ndharmas exist only in the present. The Sautr\u0101ntika\nexplained causal interaction among past and future dharmas by\nreference to the idea of \u201cseeds\u201d (b\u012bja), or\nmodifications in subsequent dharma series. The\nSautr\u0101ntika theory of seeds is the precursor of two extremely\nimportant concepts of later Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist thought,\nnamely, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s concepts of \u201cstore\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) and of\nBuddha-nature (tath\u0101gatagarbha) (Cox 1995, 94\u201395; Gethin\n1998, 222). The Therav\u0101da theory of causal conditioning, as set\nout in the Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na, proposes a set of\ntwenty-four conditional relations (paccaya) that account for\nall possible ways in which a phenomenon may function in conditioning\nthe rise of another phenomenon. The twenty-four conditional relations\nare: 1) root cause (hetupaccaya); 2) object support; 3)\npredominance; 4) proximity; 5) contiguity; 6) simultaneity; 7)\nreciprocity; 8) support; 9) decisive support; 10) pre-existence 11)\npost-existence; 12) habitual cultivation; 13) karma; 14) fruition; 15)\nnutriment; 16) controlling faculty; 17) jh\u0101na \u2013 a\nrelation specific to meditation attainments; 18) path \u2013 a\nrelation specific to the stages on the Buddhist path; 19) association;\n20) dissociation; 21) presence; 22) absence; 23) disappearance; 24)\n non-disappearance.[15]\n The majority of the Therav\u0101da twenty-four conditions have\ncounterparts in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da theory and both systems\nshow various other parallel interests and points of resemblance. The\nlikelihood, then, is that the two systems originated before the two\nschools separated and continued to evolve after their separation\n(Conze 1962, 152\u2013153; Kalupahana 1961, 173). \nTheir differences notwithstanding, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and\nthe Therav\u0101da theories of causal conditioning are based on the\nnotions that dharmas are psycho-physical events that perform\nspecific functions, and that to define what a dhamma is\nrequires one to determine what it does (Gethin 1992A, 150). It turns\nout, then, that the relative positioning of each dharma\nwithin a network of causes and conditions is, first and foremost, a\nmeans for its individuation. Only in a subsidiary sense is this\nnetwork an analysis of causal efficacy. What reappears here is the\ncategorial dimension of the dharma analysis qua a\nmetaphysical theory of mental events in terms of sameness of\nconditional relations. Analogous to the space-time coordinate system\nthat enables one to identify and describe material objects, the\nnetwork of conditional relations may be seen as a coordinate system\nthat locates within it any given dharma, implying that to be\na dharma is to be an event that has a place in that web of\nrelations\u2014an idea reminiscent of Donald Davidson\u2019s\nprinciple of sameness of causes and effects as a condition of identity\nof events (2001 119\u2013120 & 154\u2013161). Two\ndharma instances of the same type would fit into the web of\ncausal conditions in exactly the same way, but would then be\ndistinguished as individual instances on the grounds of their unique\ndegrees and modes of causal efficacy. \nIn attempting to account for what effects liberating insight and what\nmakes up the awakened mind, Abhidharma inquiries extended into the\nfield of epistemology. We have seen that the Abhidharma\u2019s\nanalysis of sentient experience reveals that what we perceive as a\ntemporally extended, uninterrupted flow of phenomena is, in fact, a\nrapidly occurring sequence of causally connected consciousness moments\nor cittas (i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncaitta\/cetasika), each with its particular object. The mature\nAbhidharma thus assimilates the analysis of\nphenomena-in-time-as-constituted-by-consciousness with a highly\ncomplex description of the consciousness process, dissolving the\ncausal relations between ordered successions of consciousness moments\ninto the activity of perception. As previously noted in section 2, for\nthe Abhidharma, as in Buddhist epistemology in general, sensory\nperception is the paradigm of perceptual, sentient experience. Like\nevery instance of consciousness, sensory perception is intentional,\nencapsulated in the interaction among the sense faculties, their\ncorresponding types of discriminative consciousness, and their\nappropriate sense objects. Different Buddhist schools, however, held\ndifferent positions on the distinctive nature of perceptual\nexperience, and on the specific roles of the sense faculties and\nstatus of sense objects in it. The Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma and the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika both espouse a view that\nproposes a direct contact between perceptual consciousness and its\nsense objects, the latter being understood as sensibilia, for\nwhat we perceive are not objects of common sense but their sensible\nqualities. We may characterize this view as phenomenalist realism\n(Dreyfus 1997, 331 & 336). \nThe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma sets out its theory of the consciousness\nprocess (citta-v\u012bthi) in its commentaries and manuals,\nmainly in the works of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta (5th century CE), and\nAnuruddha (10th or 11th century CE), based on earlier descriptions in\nthe Dhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Vism XIV 111\u2013124,\nXVII 126\u2013145; Dhs-a 82\u2013106 & 267\u2013287;\nVibh-a 155\u2013160; Abhidh-s 17\u201321). The\ntheory is not separate from the dhamma taxonomy and the\nanalysis of citta as previously outlined in section 2.\nRather, in congruency with the notion of existence (whether categorial\nor ontological) as functioning, it analyzes sensory perception as\nresulting from particular functions that are performed by the\neighty-nine citta types revealed by the foregoing taxonomy.\nAccording to this analysis, the specific functions in the\nconsciousness flow occur at particular instants of that continuum, as\nthe normal flow of consciousness involves the mind picking up and\nputting down sense objects by means of successive sets of associated\nmental factors. The result is a fairly static account of mental and\nmaterial phenomena as they arise in consciousness over a series of\nconsciousness\n moments.[16] \nRestricting the account to the consciousness process of ordinary\nbeings, two types of process are described: five-sense-door processes\n(pa\u00f1cadv\u0101ra) and mind-door processes\n(manodv\u0101ra). These may occur in succession, or mind-door\nprocesses may occur independently. Five-sense-door processes account\nfor sensory perception as information is directly received from the\nfields of the five physical sense faculties. Mind-door processes\ninternalize the information received through the sense faculties and\ncharacterize the mind that is absorbed in thought or memory. Objects\nat the \u201cdoor\u201d of the mind, which is treated in Buddhist\nthought as a sixth sense faculty, may be past, present, or future,\npurely conceptual or even transcendent. Normally, however, the object\nat the mind door will be either a past memory or a concept. If there\nis no perceptual activity, as is the case in deep, dreamless sleep,\nthe mind is in a state of rest called inactive mode\n(bhava\u1e45ga). Throughout one\u2019s life, the same type\nof citta performs this function of the inactive mind that is\nthe natural mode to which the mind reverts. The mind switches from its\ninactive mode to a simple mind-door process when a concept or memory\noccurs and no attention is directed to the other five sense fields.\nThe simplest mind-door process is a succession of the following\nfunctions: 1) adverting to the object of thought: a function that\nlasts one moment and becomes internalized as an object support; 2)\nimpulsion: occurs for up to seven moments and performs the function of\nthe mind\u2019s responding actively to the object with wholesome or\nunwholesome karma; 3) retaining: holding on to the object of the\nconsciousness process for one or two moments. \nThe mind switches from its inactive mode to any of the five-sense-door\nprocesses when an object occurs at the \u201cdoor\u201d of the\nappropriate sense faculty. This process of sensory perception involves\na greater number of functions: 1) disturbed inactive mind: a function\nthat arises due to the stimulus of the sense object. It lasts for two\nmoments, during which sensory contact takes place, i.e., a physical\nimpact of the sense object on the physical matter of the appropriate\nsense faculty; 2) adverting: lasts one moment, during which the mind\nturns towards the object at the appropriate sense \u201cdoor;\u201d\n3) perceiving: lasts one moment and is the sheer perception of the\nsense object with minimal interpretation; 4) receiving: lasts one\nmoment and performs the intermediary role of enabling transit to and\nfrom the appropriate discriminative consciousness, whether visual,\nauditory, etc.; 5) investigating: lasts one moment and performs the\nrole of establishing the nature of the sense object and of determining\nthe mind\u2019s response to that object that has just been\nidentified; 6) impulsion: same as in the mind-door process; 7)\nretaining: same as in the mind-door process. As an example, visual\nperception involves not only seeing itself, but also a succession of\nmoments of fixing of the visual object in the mind, recognition of its\ngeneral features, and identification of its nature. In both the\nmind-door and five-sense door processes, the sense faculty and its\nsense object condition the arising of a present moment of a\ncorresponding apprehending consciousness, that is, perception here is\nmodeled on simultaneous conditioning. And in both the mind-door and\nfive-sense door processes, when the retaining function ceases, the\nmind reenters its inactive mode. \nThe consciousness types that perform most of the functions that make\nup the mind-door and the five-sense-door processes fall into the\ncategory of resultant cittas, that is, those that are the\nresult of past actively wholesome or unwholesome consciousness. This\nmeans that the experience of the sense data presented to one\u2019s\nmind is determined by one\u2019s previous actions and is beyond of\none\u2019s immediate control. Whenever one remembers or\nconceptualizes, sees, hears, smells, tastes, or touches something that\nis desirable or pleasing, one experiences a result of previous\nwholesome consciousness. And vice versa with objects that are\nundesirable or unpleasing and previous unwholesome consciousness\nrespectively. Only in the final stage of the consciousness process,\nwhen the mind has chosen to respond actively to its object in some\nway, actively present wholesome or unwholesome consciousness operates\nand constitutes karma that will bear future results. The Abhidhamma\nthus \u201cprovides an exact small-scale analysis of the process of\ndependent arising\u201d (Gethin 1998, 216). \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika proposes a similar\naccount of sensory perception, but argues that the sensory object\nexists as a real entity. The Sautr\u0101ntika theory of perception,\nhowever, is rather different. It rests on the Sautr\u0101ntika radical\nview of momentariness, according to which there is no real duration\nbut only a succession of infinitesimal moments, and on its view of\ncausation, according to which causes cease to exist when their effects\ncome into existence. The application of these principles to sensory\nperception makes it difficult to explain how perception directly\napprehends sense objects, for it implies that objects have ceased when\ntheir apprehending consciousness arises. The Sautr\u0101ntika reply is\nthat consciousness does not have direct access to its sense objects.\nBy contrast to phenomenalist realism, the Sautr\u0101ntika view of\nperceptual consciousness may be characterized as representationalism:\nit sees perception as apprehending its objects indirectly, through the\nmediation of aspects (\u0101k\u0101ra) representative of\ntheir objects (Dreyfus 1997, 335 & 380\u2013381). \nWhat is common to all the three main Abhidharma\ntraditions\u2014Therav\u0101da, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, and\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2014is that they manifest a somewhat similar\nparadigm shift towards reducing the phenomenal, causally conditioned\nworld into the activity of cognition and consciousness. This shift was\npart of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain,\nand Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical\nquestions about the nature of the external world and the self, and\nfocused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language.\nTheir purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and\nmeans of valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this\nepistemological turn saw the rise of thinkers such as Asa\u1e45ga and\nVasubandhu, the founders of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (400\u2013480 CE),\nand, most notably, Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti (around 500 CE)\nwho developed sophisticated logical and philosophical systems\n(ibid, 15\u201319). The Abhidharma, then, sets the stage for\nthis epistemological turn. The new emphasis becomes dominant from the\nperiod of the vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward and is\nevident in a shift in the terminology used by the Abhidharma to\ndescribe the nature of dharmas. This terminological shift is\nindicated by the terms \u201cparticular inherent\ncharacteristic\u201d (Skt., svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\nsalakkha\u1e47a) and \u201cgeneral characteristic\u201d\n(Skt., s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\ns\u0101m\u0101nyalakkha\u1e47a). \nThe term lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\/lakkha\u1e47a means a mark, or\na specific characteristic that distinguishes an indicated object from\nothers. The Logicians use this term in the sense of\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of a concept or logical category. The\nAbhidharma applies it to the practice of the discernment of\ndharmas, distinguishing between multiple generic\ncharacteristics a dharma shares with other dharmas\nand (at least) one particular inherent characteristic that defines a\ndharma as that very individual occurrence distinct from any\nother instances of its type. The post-canonical Abhidharma thus\nassimilates the concept of the particular inherent characteristic with\nthat of intrinsic nature. \u201cDhammas,\u201d the\nTherav\u0101din commentarial literature states, \u201care so called\nbecause they bear their particular inherent characteristics\u201d\n(Vibh-a 45; Vibh-m\u1e6d 35; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 79; Vism XV 3), and a particular characteristic \u201cis\nthe intrinsic nature that is not held in common by other\ndhammas\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d II 137). Used in\nconjunction or interchangeably with intrinsic nature, the particular\ninherent characteristic constitutes a dhamma\u2019s unique\ndefinition (Vism VI 19, 35). It is an epistemological and\nlinguistic determinant of a dhamma as a knowable instance\nthat is defined by a distinct verbal description. \nThe Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 of the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika similarly distinguishes\nbetween a dharma\u2019s particular inherent and generic\ncharacteristics and identifies the former with intrinsic nature, thus\ndiscriminating \u201clevels in the apprehension or discernment of\ndharmas that serve to clarify the ambiguity encountered in\nthe application of the term svabh\u0101va to both individual\ndharmas and to categorial groups\u201d (Cox 2004A, 575). The\ndifference between the analytical description of dharmas in\nterms of their intrinsic nature or their characteristics, notes Cox\n(ibid, 576), is that \u201cwhereas intrinsic nature acquires\nits special significance in the context of exegetical categorization,\nthe starting point for the characteristics lies in perspectivistic\ncognition. Ontology is a concern for both systems, but the shift in\nterminology from intrinsic nature to the characteristics reflects a\nconcurrent shift from a category-based abstract ontology to an\nepistemological ontology that is experientially or cognitively\ndetermined.\u201d This new epistemological emphasis looms in through\na modified definition of existence proposed by the mature\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegesis that sees the causal efficacy\nunderlying all existence as cognitive. Representing this development\nin the history of Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da thought is Sa\u1e45ghabhadra\n(fifth century CE), who states in his\nNy\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra: \u201cto be an object-field that\nproduces cognition (buddhi) is the true characteristic of\nexistence\u201d (ibid). This means that dharmas as\nthe constituents of our experiential world are objectively\nidentifiable through cognition. \nIn sum, the Abhidharma project, as evident by the dharma\ntheory and its supporting doctrines, is, at bottom, epistemologically\noriented. Yet the project also intends to ascertain that every\nconstituent of the experiential world is knowable and nameable, and\nthat the words and concepts used in the discourse that develops around\nthe discernment of these constituents uniquely define their\ncorresponding referents. The dharma analysis therefore paves\nthe way for conceptual realism: a worldview that is based on the\nnotion of truth as consisting in a correspondence between our concepts\nand statements, on the one hand, and the features of an independent,\ndeterminate reality, on the other hand. Conceptual realism does not\nnecessarily have implications for the ontological status of this\nreality as externally existing. But to espouse such a position is to\nmake a significant move away from the earliest Buddhist teaching that\npresents the Buddha\u2019s view of language as\n conventional.[17]"},"3":{"chunk_id":"3b1dcc3a3b00e494ae68012206e08988","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":[],"chunk_type":"full_article","philosophers":[],"concepts":["Sections 3\u20135","Major League"],"content":"\nIn the accounts we give of one another, claims about our\nabilities appear to be indispensable. Some abilities are so\nwidespread that many who have them take them for granted, such as the\nability to walk, or to write one\u2019s name, or to tell a hawk from a\nhandsaw. Others are comparatively rare and notable, such as the\nability to hit a Major League fastball, or to compose a symphony, or\nto tell an elm from a beech. In either case, however, when we ascribe\nsuch abilities to one another we have the impression that we are\nmaking claims that, whether they are worth saying or not, are at least\nsometimes true. The impression of truth exerts a pressure towards\ngiving a philosophical theory of ability. It is not an option, at\nleast at the outset, to dismiss all our talk of ability as fiction or\noutright falsehood. A theory of ability can be reasonably expected to\nsay what it is to have an ability in a way that vindicates the\nappearance of truth. Such a theory will deserve the name\n\u2018philosophical\u2019 insofar as it gives an account, not of\nthis or that range of abilities, but of abilities generally. \nThis article falls into three parts. The first part, Sections 1 and 2,\nstates a framework for discussing philosophical theories of ability.\nSection 1 will say more about the distinction between abilities and\nother powers of agents and objects. Section 2 will make some formal\ndistinctions that are helpful for framing any theory of ability. The\nsecond part, Sections 3\u20135, surveys theories of ability that have\nbeen defended in the philosophical literature. Section\u00a03 concerns\nthe most prominent kind of theory, on which abilities are to be\nunderstood in terms of a hypothetical relating an agent\u2019s actions\nto her volitions. Section 4 concerns theories that are not\nhypothetical in this way, but that nonetheless retain the basic\nreductive orientation of hypothetical theories. Section 5 then\ndiscusses various alternative theories of ability that have been\nproposed in the recent literature. The third part, Section 6, turns to\nthe relationship between a theory of ability and the free will\ndebates. Such debates often involve claims about agents\u2019\nabilities, and many have hoped that getting clearer on abilities\nthemselves could resolve, or at least shed light on, such debates. The\naim of this last section will be to assess whether these hopes are\nreasonable ones. \nWhat is an ability? On one reading, this question is a demand\nfor a theory of ability of the sort described above. On\nanother reading, however, this question simply asks for a rough guide\nto what sort of things we are speaking of when we speak of\n\u2018abilities\u2019. So understood, this question is not asking\nfor a theory of ability, but for an explanation of what exactly a\ntheory of ability would be a theory of. This section will\noffer an answer to this question on this second, more modest,\nreading. \nIf one wants to give a theory of ability of the sort described at the\noutset, it is helpful for that theory to observe some formal\ndistinctions that have been marked in the literature. This section\ncanvasses two of the most important formal\u00a0distinctions. \nThe bulk of theories of ability that have been defended in the\nhistorical and contemporary literature have been what we might call\nhypothetical theories. On such views, to have an ability is\nfor it to be the case that one would act in certain ways if\none were to have certain volitions. One arrives at different theories\ndepending on how one understands the volitions in question and how\nexactly these actions would hypothetically depend on them, but\nnonetheless these views constitute something like a unified family.\nGiven their prominence and unity, it is natural to begin our survey of\ntheories of ability with them. \nThere is a surprising disconnect between the way abilities have been\ndiscussed in the philosophical literature in the tradition of Hume and\nthe way that they have been approached in more recent work in logic\nand linguistics. Here, ability claims are understood as categorical\npossibility claims: claims about what some agent does in some\nnon-actual state of affairs (or \u2018possible world\u2019). Let a\nmodal theory of ability be any theory on which claims about\nan agent\u2019s abilities are understood in terms of claims about\nwhat that agent in fact does at some possible world (or set of\nworlds). The idea that some such modal theory of ability must be true\nis a presumption of much formal work on ability and\nability-ascriptions. Yet there are serious challenges to the idea that\nability is in this sense a modality. \nThe foregoing has indicated serious concerns about the adequacy of the\northodox approaches to ability and its ascription: the conditional\nanalysis (CA), and the modal analysis (MA), of which (CA) is arguably\njust a special case. This raises the question of what a\nnon-hypothetical and non-modal account of ability and its ascription\nmight look like. \nSince abilities are, as noted in Section 1.1, a kind of power, one\nnatural idea is to analyze abilities in terms of some other kind of\npower. This appeal may proceed in different ways. One is by appealing\nto dispositions, and by analyzing abilities in terms of this\npurportedly better-understood kind of power. Another is by departing\nmore radically from the standard ontology of recent metaphysics, and\nanalyzing ability in terms of some new and distinctive variety of\npower. We will consider these approaches in turn in Sections 5.1 and\n5.2. Finally, in Section 5.3, we will turn to miscellaneous\nalternative approaches to ability, which reject the conditional and\nmodal analyses, but which do not purport to analyze abilities in terms\nof powers either. \nThus far our questions about abilities have been formal ones: we have\nbeen asking what it is to have an ability without concerning ourselves\nwith the substantive work that a theory of ability might have to do.\nBut there is much work to be had for a theory of ability: abilities\nhave figured as unexplained explainers in a range of philosophical\ntheories, for example in accounts of concepts (Millikan 2000), of\nknowledge (Greco 2009, Sosa 2007), and of \u2018knowing what it\u2019s\nlike\u2019 (Lewis 1988). Perhaps the most prominent substantive role\nfor a theory of ability\u00a0has been the uses to which accounts of\nability have been put in the free will debates. So let us close with a\nbrief survey of what work a theory of ability might be expected to do\nin those debates. \nQuestions about abilities have figured most prominently in debates\nover compatibilism. \u2018Compatibilism\u2019 is used in many ways,\nbut let us understand it here as the thesis that the ability to\nperform actions one does not perform is compossible with the truth of\ndeterminism, which we may take to be the view that the facts about the\npast and the laws jointly determine the facts about the present and\nall future moments. (We should sharply distinguish this view, which we\nmight call classical compatibilism, from more recent views\nsuch as the \u2018semi-compatibilism\u2019 of Fischer and Ravizza\n1998). Insofar as compatibilism, so understood, has been explicitly\ndefended, these defenses have made appeal to theories of ability,\nnotably the conditional analysis and its variants, as well as the\ndispositionalist analysis favored by the new dispositionalists. \nIn the discussion of the conditional analysis, we distinguished\nbetween global and local counterexamples to\nhypothetical theories of ability, where the former appealed to the\nfact that any such theory would render ability compatible with\ndeterminism which, according to the objector, it is not. There we\nnoted the dialectical limitations of such counterexamples, namely the\ncontentiousness of their main premise. But compatibilists have often\nbeen guilty of what seems to be the opposite mistake. Namely, they\nhave offered theories of ability which show abilities to be compatible\nwith determinism, and have argued from this to the claim that\nsuch abilities are indeed compatible with determinism. \nThe shortcomings of this strategy are nicely diagnosed by Peter van\nInwagen. After surveying the local counterexamples that arise for\nvarious hypothetical theories of ability, van Inwagen imagines that we\nhave arrived at the best possible hypothetical theory of ability,\nwhich he labels \u2018the Analysis\u2019. van Inwagen then\nwrites: \nWhat does the Analysis do for us? How does it affect our understanding\nof the Compatibility Problem? It does very little for us, so far as I\ncan see, unless we have some reason to think it is correct.\nMany compatibilists seem to think that they need only present a\nconditional analysis of ability, defend it against, or modify it in\nthe face of, such counter-examples as may arise, and that they have\nthereby done what is necessary to defend compatibilism. That is not\nhow I see it. The particular analysis of ability that a compatibilist\npresents is, as I see it, simply one of his premisses; his central\npremiss, in fact. And premisses need to be defended. (van Inwagen\n1983, 121)\n \nvan Inwagen\u2019s point is that, provided the incompatibilist has\noffered arguments for the claim that such abilities are\nincompatible with determinism\u2014as, in van Inwagen\u2019s\npresentation, the incompatibilist has\u2014the production of an\nanalysis is as yet no answer to those arguments. For those arguments\nare also arguments, inter alia, against the\ncompatibilist\u2019s favored account of ability. \nThere are, then, several obstacles for the compatibilist who wishes to\nappeal to an account of ability in defense of compatibilism. First,\nthere is the general difficulty of actually giving an extensionally\nadequate theory of ability. In addition, we have now turned up a\ncouple of more specific challenges to the compatibilist. There is van\nInwagen\u2019s point just outlined, namely that arguments for the\nincompatibility of abilities and determinism are, inter alia,\narguments against any theory of ability that is congenial to the\ncompatibilist. And, finally, there is the point that we encountered in\nour discussion of the new dispositionalism in Section 5.1, which is\nthat certain platitudes about ability \u2014 in particular, those\ninvolved in certain judgments about moral responsibility \u2014 may\nbe recalcitrant to compatibilist treatments. Taken together, these\npoints seem to pose a serious obstacle to any theory of ability that\nis both compatible with determinism and in accord with our ordinary\njudgments about what ability requires. \nWhat is the compatibilist to say in light of these obstacles? One\nresponse is to make a distinction between two kinds of compatibilist\nproject. (Compare Pryor 2000 on responses to skepticism). One project\nis to convince someone moved by the incompatibilist\u2019s\narguments to retreat from her position. Call this ambitious\ncompatibilism. For precisely the reasons van Inwagen gives, it is\ndoubtful that any theory of ability will suffice for a defense of\nambitious compatibilism. There is another project, however, that the\ncompatibilist might be engaging in. Let us say that, for some reason\nor other, she herself is not convinced by the incompatibilist\u2019s\nargument. She is still left with an explanatory burden, namely to\nexplain, if only to her own satisfaction, how it could\nbe that abilities are compatible with the truth of determinism.\nHere the compatibilist\u2019s aim is not to convince the\nincompatibilist of the error of her ways, but simply to work out a\nsatisfactory conception of compatibilism. Let us call this\nmodest compatibilism. This distinction is not often made, and\nit is not always clear which of these projects classical\ncompatibilists are engaged in. If the latter project is indeed part of\nclassical compatibilism, then we may grant many of the above points\nwhile still granting the theory of ability a central place in defenses\nof compatibilism. For it may be that, though a theory of ability is of\nno use to the ambitious compatibilist, it has a crucial role to play\nin the defense of modest compatibilism. \nEven these compatibilist aspirations, however, may be overly\noptimistic, or at least premature. For in surveying theories of\nability we have turned up serious difficulties, for both hypothetical\nand non-hypothetical approaches, which do not appear to turn on issues\nabout determinism. So it may be that the best hope for progress is to\npursue theories of ability while setting to one side the problems\nraised in the free will debates. For given the difficulties posed by\nabilities, and given the significance of theories of ability for areas\nof philosophy quite removed from the free will debates, there is\nsomething to be said for pursuing a theory of ability while embracing,\nif only temporarily, a certain quietism about the puzzles that\ndeterminism may pose."},"4":{"chunk_id":"693ad0d4cc172433d64395e489a37627","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":[],"chunk_type":"full_article","philosophers":["Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas","Neo-Platonic","Judaism","Alfonso de Valladolid"],"concepts":["Abner of Burgos","Abner","Jews","Spanish","Aristotelian Jewish","Christianity","Maimonidean","Aristotelian","Judaism","Aristotle","Christian","Jewish"],"content":"\nAbner of Burgos (Alfonso de Valladolid; c. 1260\u20131347) was\nperhaps the most important philosopher in the stream of Jewish Spanish\nrabbi-apostates in the 14th and 15th centuries.\nIn the first part of his life, Abner was an Aristotelian Jewish\nphilosopher. However, at the age of 60 (if Pablo de Santa Maria is a\nreliable source) after years of hesitation, he became a Neo-Platonic\nChristian, making him one of the very few philosophers (much less\nphilosopher-rabbis) to change his philosophical opinion (and religion)\nduring the Middle Ages. The majorities of his works are primarily\npolemical, and try to convince his former fellow Jews to become\nChristian, as he did. However, in his polemical writings, Abner built\nan original philosophical critique of both traditional Judaism and the\nAristotelian (and Maimonidean) philosophical interpretation of\nJudaism. Another part of his philosophical aim was a very radical\ninterpretation of Christianity aimed at convincing his Jewish audience\nthat his Christianity was superior to traditional and philosophical\nJudaism. Abner was one of the first philosophical and scientific\ncritics of Aristotle, as well as one of the more radical Neo-Platonic\nthinkers of Christianity during the Middle Ages. His works had a very\nimportant impact on Jewish philosophy at the latter end of the Middle\nAges, and some of his opinions influenced, through Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas, general Western philosophy. \nThere are not many sources on the life of Abner. The majority of the\nsources are autobiographical passages in his works (especially\nMostrador de Justicia). Abner was born around 1260, probably\nin the Jewish community of Burgos, one of the major communities in\nCastile. While still Jewish, Abner worked as a book trader, a rabbi,\nand he may have been a physician as well. During this time he was the\nhead of a yeshiva (Jewish academy) in Burgos, but we do not know if\nthis yeshiva was a public institution or just a private group of\nstudents that met in his home. We know from a former pupil, Rabbi\nIsaac Pulgar, and from the sources that he utilizes in his works, that\nduring the Jewish period of his life, Abner was a philosopher, being a\npart of the Maimonidean-Averroist trend of Jewish philosophy at the\ntime. \nIn spite of the majority opinion of modern\n scholars,[1]\n Abner probably was not a Kabbalist before his conversion to\nChristianity. This mistake is based essentially on two sources: the\nfact that some of Abner\u2019s arguments for the Trinity and Incarnation\ncan be interpreted as deriving from Kabbalistic sources, and the\nexistence of another Rabbi Abner (not a common name for Jews of his\ntime), a Kabbalist whom Rabbi Isaac of Acre cited many times. In my\nopinion, Abner\u2019s argument for the Trinity and Incarnation is not based\non Kabbalistic sources, but stems from his Neo-Platonic and standard\nChristian scriptural\n background.[2]\n Additionally, Abner (the apostate) did not use many important\nKabbalistic\n sources.[3]\n His opinions are not the same as the other Rabbi Abner\u2019s (the one\nthat Rabbi Isaac of Acre quotes), and we can see that the two authors\ndo not share the same background, nor do they use the same sources,\nwith Abner utilizing almost entirely sources taken from the Jewish\nphilosophical and traditional rabbinic\n corpuses.[4]\n almost all of Rabbi Abner\u2019s sources are taken from the commentary of\nNahmanides to the Torah, a book that Abner the apostate almost never\nquoted.  \nThe beginning of Abner\u2019s doubts about Judaism began with the incident\nof a false messiah in Avila in 1295. According to Abner, the Jews of\nthe community, which is in North Castile, went outside the city to\nwelcome the messiah, but instead of the messiah they received a\nrainfall of crosses that stuck to their clothes. Some of the Jews who\nwitnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled\nin Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing\nexile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of\nfeeling ambivalent (i.e., around 1317) Abner wrote about his first\nrevelation in a\n dream.[5]\n In his dream he saw a man that told him to be \u201ca teacher of\nrighteousness\u201d (mostrador de justicia, not\ncoincidentally the name of Abner\u2019s main book) and to bring his people\nto freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the\nJewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream\nwherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the\nclothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the\nChristian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around\n1320\/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the\ncollegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation\nof Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the\nconclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be\nsaved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre\nand that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North\nCastile around 1336\u20131339. There was a public disputation between\nAbner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335\u20131336 on the\nsubject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates. This dispute\nwas the main reason for the decree against this part of the Jewish\nprayer (birkatha-minim) by Alfonso XI in 1336. Abner\nprobably died in 1347 or later. \nAbner\u2019s works may be divided into three different categories: polemic,\nscientific and philosophic. \nPolemic works: Mostradorde Justicia is the earliest\nand most important work of those writings of Abner that have survived.\nOnly a translation (probably by Abner himself) in Castilian exists\ntoday, whereas the original Hebrew was lost. The book starts with a\nbrief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his\nconversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part\nof the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew\n(the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of\npolemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a\nChristian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to\nbelieve in his ostensibly false religion. The book is divided into ten\nchapters, with each chapter being subdivided into a number of\nparagraphs. Each paragraph is a speech by one of the protagonists of\nthe\n debate.[6] \nSummary of the chapters: \nResponses to the Blasphemer (Teshuvot la-Meharef): this book\nsurvived both in the original\n Hebrew[7]\n and in a Castilian\n translation.[8]\n This book is a response to the different letters that Abner\u2019s only\nknown student, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, wrote against his determinist and\nChristian\n writings.[9]\n Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book\ncontains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an\nintroduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his\nphilosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2)\nthe Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and\nquotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary\nexistence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof\nof the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and\nother Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim). In this last part, which\ntakes up almost half the book, Abner argues that the messiah had\nalready come and that Christianity is true. \nWhile Abner\u2019s arguments regarding the Trinity and Incarnation are\ngenerally more developed in Mostradorde Justicia,\nthe philosophical importance of this work resides with his critique of\nthe Jewish philosopher. Here Abner distinguishes between the regular\nJewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be\nsaved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless\nand are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only\nthe people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence\nafter death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these\nphilosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of\nChristianity. Parts of Abner\u2019s critique of Jewish philosophers in this\nbook most probably influenced Crescas. \nLibro de la Ley (Book of the Law). This work\nsurvived only\n fragmentally[10]\n in Castilian. The major argument of Abner in this book is that the\nJewish people forgot the secrets of the Torah, which are manifested by\nthe Christian doctrines, especially the Trinity. \nSefer Teshuvot ha-Meshubot (The Book of Responses to the\nApostasies) exists only in\n Hebrew.[11]\n There are three polemic\n letters[12]\n that deal especially with scriptural arguments on the subject of the\ncoming of the\n messiah.[13] \nThe two major subjects of the philosophical polemical works of Abner\nare the Trinity and Incarnation. Abner had an original view on the\nTrinity. In his opinion, one can prove philosophically the reality of\nthe\n Trinity.[14]\n He claimed that only the division of the divine source of the world\ncan explain the diversity of the world. The infinite force of God (the\nfather) would burn the finite matter of the world if it were not for\nsome \u201ctransformer\u201d that adapted the divine force to the\nfinitude of matter (the son). Abner distinguished between two parts of\nthe son. The superior son is part of the transcendent divinity. The\ninferior son is the divine essence in all the different parts of the\nworld. The transformer of the divine force and essence is the superior\nson. \nRegarding the theory of the divine attributes, Abner also had an\noriginal opinion. He distinguished between the attributes that are the\nessence of God and the attributes that are essential to God. The\nattributes of the essence of God divide themselves only within the\npersonas of the Trinity. The rest of the attributes are only essential\nto God (and could be attributed to any one of the personas). This\ndivision of the divine attributes influenced Rabbi Hasdai Crescas,who\nlater influenced Spinoza. \nAbner\u2019s opinion on Incarnation was also very original. According to\nAbner, the essence of God is in the entire world. The world is\ncomposed only of corrupted matter and of divine essence in different\ndegrees of purity. Even the most corrupted matter has inside itself\nsome divine essence. The divine essence gives the corporeal form to\nmatter and produces in it its dimensions. The uniqueness of a human\nbeing is the capacity to purify one\u2019s matter, thereby reaching a\nhigher degree of divine essence. According to Abner, what made Jesus\nunique was that he was born of the highest matter, enabling him to\nunite with the highest degree of divine essence that a human can\nattain. Abner thought that the superior son does not incarnate in this\nworld. Jesus was only the highest degree of the inferior son that is\npresent in the essences of the entire world. \nThe opinion of Abner on Incarnation is closely related to his view of\nthe doctrine of Original Sin. In Abner\u2019s opinion, the reason for the\noriginal sin was Adam\u2019s lack of comprehension. Adam thought that his\nintellect, which is an incarnation of divinity in people, was God, and\nhe therefore wrongly concluded that he was God. In order to fix Adam\u2019s\nerror, humanity needed the Torah of Moses, which emphasized the unity\nof God in an exaggerated form and therefore explained (somewhat\ninaccurately) that God does not incarnate in the World at all. Only\nafter this critical step, humanity was able to understand that, though\nthere is divinity in humans, this divinity is not an independent God,\nbut rather a part of the divine essence in the whole world. The Law of\nMoses that came to purify the world from idolatry has some problems.\nIt does not enable the full emancipation of humanity from sin and\nerror. Abner claimed that the negation of the incarnation of God in\nthe world leads to negating the possibility of life after death. The\npossibility of life after death comes from understanding the\nincarnation of divinity in all humans. Negating life after death\ncauses immorality. The Torah has to put up with all these inaccuracies\nin order to achieve its main goal, which is taking humanity out of the\nsin of idolatry (by believing that God is one). The outcome, though\nbetter than its predecessor, is ultimately a lost situation which\nhumanity cannot overcome on its own. For that reason, God sent Jesus\n(who was born with a higher degree of matter and divine essence). Due\nto the divinity within Jesus, his miracles and his resurrection,\npeople are able to understand that within everything in the world\nthere is some divine essence that is part of the inferior son, and\nthat the origin of all the divinity in the world is the superior son.\nThis understanding enables salvation from the original sin and\nrepresents a true understanding of the relation between God and the\nworld. The role of the sacramentental Mass is to remind us of the\ndivine aspect of Jesus\u2019 essence, as well as of all the miracles that\nJesus performed and to continue their influence in our present\ntime. \nWe see that this opinion regarding the Trinity and Incarnation\ncontradict the official dogma of the Catholic Church at the time of\nAbner. In his opinion, the incarnation of divinity in Jesus did not\nbypass the regular process of the emanation of the divine essence in\nthe world. Rather, the manifestation of Jesus represented the pinnacle\nof incarnation of divinity, which, though indeed present in the entire\nworld, yet in Jesus occurred in the purest form possible. This opinion\nof Abner, similar to his other philosophical views, was a part of the\nradical Neo-Platonic interpretation of Christianity. The difference\nbetween him and the other Neo-Platonic Christian philosophers, like\nMaster Eckard, is the different sources from which they were\ninfluenced. Abner did not utilize the traditional Neo-Platonic\nChristian sources, like Dionysius the Areopagite. We do not see in any\npart of his work that he was aware of the existence of these sources.\nOn the other hand, Abner did utilize some Arabic and Jewish sources.\nThe origin of his uncommon position on Christianity is found in his\nopposition to the common Aristotelian-Maimonidean-Averroist trend of\nJewish philosophy. Abner, similar to Spinoza after him, thought that\nthe explanations of these thinkers on the question of the creation of\nthe world by a perfect God were not sufficient and ultimately\ninaccurate. In place of these responses, Abner proposed his radical\ninterpretation of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, an\ninterpretation that was uninfluenced by the theological Christian\ntradition.  \nOne of the more important philosophical opinions of Abner was his\ndeterministic\n view.[15]\n Abner devoted his book Ofrenda de Zelos (Minhat\nKena\u2019ot in the original lost Hebrew text), along with other\nworks that have since been lost, to the question of determinism and\nfree\n will.[16]\n In the beginning of this book, Abner describes the opinion of his\nformer pupil Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, who denies God\u2019s foreknowledge of\nhuman decisions. After the explication of this opinion and its\nnegation, Abner explains his deterministic opinion. Abner believed\nthat people have free will in a limited sense, but act in a determined\nway in the broader sense. People are free in their relation to\nthemselves, meaning that if a person is separated from the causes that\ninfluence him or her (e.g., education, society\u2019s influences) while\ndebating between two options, one is then really free to choose either\nof the two options. In this specific case a person can then utilize\nhis or her will and choose freely between the two options. However, if\none takes into account all the causes that influence his or her will,\nwe may conclude that these causes limits that person\u2019s will to only\none of the two options. In the opinion of Abner, people are like wax,\nas follows: Wax may be melted and sculpted into many different shapes.\nHowever, the person who sculpts the wax determines its present form as\nonly one of those options. The same is true about people: In\nthemselves, they have the ability to choose between different\npossibilities, but their relation to the outside world determines\ntheir choices. We can see from this example how strong the determinist\nview of Abner was. It is important to note that Abner defines the will\nof people as an accord between the attractive force and the\nimagination, two forces common to humans and animals. \nAbner explains in the same way the meaning of possibility and\naccident. Things are only possible in their relation to themselves. In\nrelation to the entire world and its causality, everything is truly\ndetermined. Accidents are only accidents relative to the seeming\nunlikelihood of their occurrence. However, relative to all the causal\nprocesses of the world, we see that even in the most unusual of\ncircumstances the occurrence of what appears to be an accident in fact\nhad to happen. In short, there are no accidents (according to the\npopular meaning of accident) for Abner. \nThis deterministic description of the world (based on rational\narguments) resolves the theological problem of the contradiction\nbetween the free will of people and the foreknowledge of God. In the\nopinion of Abner free will does not really exist. For him, God is the\nfirst cause; He knows all the laws of the world and therefore knows\neverything that He has determined. \nThis deterministic description leads to two theological problems. The\nfirst is why God sent commandments to people who cannot truly decide\nwhether to obey them or disobey them. The second question that arises\nis how people can receive reward or punishment for actions and\ndecisions that they do not really have any control over? Abner answers\nthe second question by explaining that forbidden things are naturally\nbad. The punishment of the sinner is not a special act of divine\nprovidence; rather it is the natural consequence of his bad action.\nThis leads us to the answer to the first question. According to Abner,\nthe goal of the Torah is to influence people to do what is right. The\nTorah and prophets (and God who sent them) act in the world in\nconformity to His nature. The only way to influence someone to do\nsomething is to give him enough causes to do it. The Torah is only\nanother cause that influences people to do what is good. Abner\ncompares reward and punishment to a father that obligates his son to\ntake medication. The medicine will always work even if the son takes\nit unhappily. The same is true with regard to all actions of people.\nWhen people do what is right, they believe they will receive a reward,\nwhile if they do what is wrong, they believe they will receive a\npunishment\u2014even if they do not essentially have the choice to do\nanything else.  \nIt is interesting to note that this philosophical book that Abner\nwrote at the end of his life, more than twenty years after his\nconversion, is almost without Christian\n references.[17]\n In spite of this, the book is full of references to Jewish sources,\nincluding the Talmud and quotations of Jewish authorities like\n Maimonides.[18]\n We see that Abner, even many years after his conversion, wrote to the\nJewish community and was part of the internal Jewish debate about the\nquestion of determinism. In fact, Abner is the first medieval Jewish\nphilosopher to argue for a deterministic explanation of the world. His\nopinion influenced Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (who paraphrased an important\npart of Ofrenda de Zelos in his major philosophical work\nThe Light of the\n Lord[19]),\n and through him, Spinoza. Some Jewish philosophers, like Rabbi Isaac\nPulgar, Rabbi Mosses from Narbonne, and Rabbi Josef Ben Shem\n Tov[20]\n respond explicitly to the determinist opinion of Abner, such that\nthere is no doubt that his opinion had a major influence on the\ninternal Jewish debate on the question of free will throughout the\n14th and 15th centuries.  \nAs we stated before, the major work of science of Abner (the New\nPhilosophy) is lost. We can still try to reconstruct some of his\nscientific opinions through some parts of his other works,\nspecifically the existing work Meyasher Aqob, Rabbi Isaac\nPulgar\u2019s brief summary of the lost work, and some scientific passages\nin Mostrador de\n Justicia.[21] \nThe first interesting opinion of Abner is his view on prime matter.\nAbner denied a necessary link, which the Aristotelians affirmed,\nbetween bodies and accidents (magnitude, weight, quantity, etc.),\nmaintaining that a body untainted by all these accidents can\nnonetheless have actual existence. He explicated his view in the\ndogmatic context of the question of the rite of\n Mass.[22]\n The rebel\u2019s main philosophical arguments against the Mass are as\nfollows: (1) How can several bodies occupy the same place? (2) How can\nJesus\u2019 body be in the bread and wine without changing them? (3) How\ncan the same body be two different materials at the same time? (4) How\ncan one debase Jesus by eating and digesting him? At the start of his\nanswer Abner emphasizes that the Mass is miraculous. Nevertheless, he\ndoes go on to offer a scientific explanation of transubstantiation.\nFor Abner, everybody has a layer of pure divine existence, to which\nare superadded other forms and accidents; but if the body is stripped\nof all of these accretions it will be reduced to the original divine\nsubstance only. In this state the body will have no boundary,\nquantity, or weight to occupy the universe, and consequently is\ninfinite. This body is the foundation of the entire material world,\nand normally\u2014with the exception of the sacrament of the Mass and\nIncarnation\u2014it does not exist without accidents (at least not in\nthe sublunary world). This matter is identified with the flesh of\nJesus, which has divine existence only, which means that Jesus\u2019 body\nis identified with prime matter. \nThe above description eliminates for Abner all of the difficulties\nposed by the rebel. The problem of the co-presence of two bodies in\none place is eliminated, because all bodies, once they have been\nstripped of their form and accidents, incorporate the infinite body of\nJesus, which fills the entire universe. After these forms have been\nremoved, the bread and wine are identified with Jesus\u2019 body. The very\nsame principle eliminates the problem of the simultaneous existence of\nJesus\u2019 body in several places, since his body fills the entire\nuniverse and transcends all definitions of place. Because his body\nalso transcends the definition of quantity, the problem of limited\nquantity is removed as well. \nAnother subject about which Abner critiques Aristotelian science is\nthe definition of place and the relation between place and body. In\nthe thought of Aristotle, the definition of place is \u2018the limit\nof the encompassing body\u2019. In his opinion, place has an\nimportant role in movement. The definition of a natural movement is\nthe movement of a body to its natural place in the world. Aristotle\nexplains that both the natural place attracts the body and that the\nbody moves on his own to its natural place. \nAbner distinguishes between the physical object and extension or\ndimension. According to Abner, dimension is \u201ca simple and subtle\nquantity detached from all movable bodies\u201d; in other words, it\nis space, independent of any physical body. Dimension is measurable\nper se, and is not linked to what occupies it. Nevertheless, Abner\u2019s\ndefinition of place is still associated with body: \u201cplace\u201d\nis the dimension occupied by a body, and it is the body that turns it\ninto \u201cplace.\u201d According to Abner, the movement of bodies\nis not due to their being attracted to some place where they must rest\nbefore resuming their movement; rather, they move because of the\ninteraction of several forces, quite independent of any particular\nplace. A body that is thrown upward rises, but if it suddenly begins\nto fall because of an opposing force, there would not be a moment of\nrest between the two opposing motions. \nThus Abner dismisses Aristotle\u2019s concept that a body is attracted to\nits natural place. Different places are not characterized by different\nqualities (inasmuch as all places are equal and are merely points in\nspace). Hence a body has no cause to move to a particular place and no\nplace is a final cause of its motion. \nWe know from Rabbi Isaac Pulgar that Abner also criticized the\nopinions of Aristotle on the possibility of a void and argues for the\nexistence of voids in his lost scientific book The New\nPhilosophy. Because of the influence of Abner on Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas, we can assume that his criticism is closely related to the\ncriticism of Crescas in the beginning of the first speech of Or\nHashem \nAbner wrote his criticism of Artistotelian science at the beginning of\nthe 14th century, approximately the same time that Ockham\nwrote his criticism of this science. In the writing and the thought of\nAbner we do not see any kind of influence of Ockham or of other late\nscholastics (the only scholastic philosopher that he cites is Thomas\nAquinas and there are no quotations from Christian sources on a\nscientific subject). It is interesting to note that the systematic\ncriticism of Aristotelian science started approximately at the same\ntime in the Jewish milieu (with the writings of Abner) and in the\nChristian milieu, with probably no relation one to the other. \nAbner\u2019s criticism of Aristotelian science had an important influence\non Crescas\u2019s thought, and through him to Pico Della Mirandola and\ngeneral Western philosophy. \nOne must distinguish between two kinds of influence Abner had. Abner\ninfluenced with his polemical works the Jewish-Christian debate until\nthe end of the Middle Ages. Some born-Christians, like Alfonso de\nEspina, and especially Jewish apostates, like Pablo de Santa Maria,\nutilized his polemical works. Against this trend, there are more than\nfive Jewish polemicist works that explicitly answer the polemical\narguments of\n Abner.[23]\n Despite the utilization of Abner in debates, his works had almost no\nphilosophical influence on Christian theology because the Christian\nparticipants in the debates utilized the quotations of the Jewish\nsources by Abner and not his theological arguments as such, which in\ntheir content were very different from the official Catholic\ndogma. \nThe second way in which Abner had lasting influence was on the purely\nphilosophical plane. It should be noted that the direct philosophical\ninfluence of Abner was only on the Jewish community. In fact we do not\nsee that any Christian philosophers read the works of Jewish apostates\nin any other forum apart from the purely polemical one. By contrast,\nin the Jewish community the works of Abner had an important impact\nuntil the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The deterministic\nopinion of Abner is with no doubt one of the major causes to the\nextensive number of works written on this subject in the\n14th and 15th centuries by Jewish philosophers.\nFor the most part, these works were against the opinion of Abner. The\nmost impressive philosophical influence of Abner was on Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas (died in 1410\/1411). Crescas was the main Jewish philosopher\nduring the end of the Middle Ages. Despite their opposite positions in\nthe Jewish-Christian debate (Crescas wrote one of the more\nphilosophical anti-Christian\n works),[24]\n Crescas borrowed some of the major original philosophical opinions of\nAbner, including determinism, the difference between the attributes of\nthe essence and the attributes that are essential, and the criticism\nof Aristotelian science. With regard to this entire subject, Crescas\nmolded his opinion using Abner combined with other sources. In spite\nof this important change, we can clearly see signs of the philosophy\nof Abner in the writing of Crescas, and these signs constitute nearly\nall the post medieval influence of Abner on Jewish and general Western\nphilosophy.

A generally accepted\ntradition has it that some time around the beginning of the third\ncentury BCE, the primitive Buddhist community divided into two parties\nor fraternities: the Sthaviras (Pali, Theriyas) and the\nMah\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ghikas, each of which thenceforth had its own\nordination traditions. Throughout the subsequent two centuries or so,\ndoctrinal disputes arose between these two parties, resulting in the\nformation of various schools of thought (v\u0101da;\n\u0101cariyav\u0101da) and teacher lineages\n(\u0101cariyakula) (Vin 51\u201354; Mhv V\n12\u201313. See Cousins 1991, 27\u201328; Frauwallner 1956, 5ff\n& 130ff; Lamotte 1988, 271ff; Wynne 2019, 269\u2013283). \nAccording to traditional Buddhist accounts, by the time the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na doctrines arose, roughly in the first century BCE,\nthere were eighteen sub-sects or schools of Sthaviras, the tradition\nancestral to the Therav\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine of\nthe elders\u201d). The number eighteen, though, became conventional\nin Buddhist historiography for symbolic and mnemonic reasons\n(Obeyesekere 1991) and, in fact, different Buddhist sources preserve\ndivergent lists of schools which sum up to more than eighteen. The\nlikelihood is that the early formative period of the Buddhist\ncommunity gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed\nspontaneously due to the geographical extension of the community over\nthe entire Indian subcontinent and subject to the particular problems\nthat confronted each monastic community (sa\u1e45gha). Each\nsa\u1e45gha tended to specialize in a specific branch of\nlearning, had its own practical customs and relations with lay\ncircles, and was influenced by the particular territories, economy,\nand use of language and dialect prevalent in its environment. Indeed,\nthe names of the \u201ceighteen schools\u201d are indicative of\ntheir origins in characteristic doctrines, geographical locations, or\nthe legacy of particular founders: for instance,\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that all\nthings exist\u201d), Sautr\u0101ntikas (\u201cthose who rely on the\ns\u016btras\u201d)\/D\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ntikas\n(\u201cthose who employ\n examples\u201d),[1]\n and Pudgalav\u0101da (\u201cthose who affirm the existence of the\nperson\u201d); Haimavatas (\u201cthose of the snowy\nmountains\u201d); or V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas (\u201cthose\naffiliated with V\u0101ts\u012bputra\u201d) respectively. As noted by\nGethin (1998, 52), rather than sects or denominations as in\nChristianity, \u201cat least some of the schools mentioned by later\nBuddhist tradition are likely to have been informal schools of thought\nin the manner of \u2018Cartesians,\u2019 \u2018British\nEmpiricists,\u2019 or \u2018Kantians\u2019 for the history of\nmodern\n philosophy.\u201d[2] \nIt is customarily assumed that the multiple ancient Buddhist schools\ntransmitted their own versions of Abhidharma collections, but only two\ncomplete canonical collections are preserved, representing two\nschools: the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, who emerged as an independent\nschool from within the Sthaviras around the second or first century\nBCE, became dominant in north, especially northwest India, and spread\nto central Asia; and the Sinhalese Therav\u0101da, a branch of the\nSthaviras that spread out in south India and parts of southeast Asia.\nThese two extant collections comprise the third of the \u201cthree\nbaskets\u201d (Skt., tripi\u1e6daka, Pali,\ntipi\u1e6daka) of the Buddhist canon. The exegetical\ntraditions of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da understand\ntheir respective canonical Abhidharma to consist of a set of seven\ntexts, though each school specifies a different set of texts. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din Abhidharma-pi\u1e6daka consists of\nthe Sa\u1e45g\u012btipary\u0101ya (Discourse on the\nCollective Recitation), the Dharmaskandha\n(Compendium of Dharmas), the\nPraj\u00f1apti\u015b\u0101stra (Manual of\nConcepts), the Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya\n(Compendium of Consciousness), the\nDh\u0101tuk\u0101ya (Compendium of Elements), the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da (Literary\nExposition), and the J\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na\n(The Foundation of Knowledge). These seven texts survive in\nfull only in their ancient Chinese translations. The Therav\u0101din\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka comprises the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i (Enumeration of\nDhammas), the Vibha\u1e45ga (Analysis),\nthe Dh\u0101tukath\u0101 (Discourse on Elements),\nthe Puggalapa\u00f1\u00f1atti (Designation of\nPersons), the Kath\u0101vatthu (Points of\nDiscussion), the Yamaka (Pairs), and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Causal Conditions). These\nseven texts are preserved in Pali and all but the Yamaka have\nbeen translated into English. \nLater generations composed commentaries on the canonical Abhidharma\nand introduced a variety of exegetical manuals that expound the\nessentials of the canonical systems. These post-canonical texts are\nthe products of single authors and display fully developed polemical\nstances and sectarian worldviews of their respective schools. Much of\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma system is contained in\nBuddhaghosa\u2019s comprehensive Visuddhimagga (The Path\nof Purification, fifth century CE). More direct introductory\nAbhidhamma manuals are Buddhadatta\u2019s\nAbhidhamm\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction to\nAbhidhamma, fifth century CE) and Anuruddha\u2019s\nAbhidhammatthasa\u1e45gaha (Compendium of the Topics of\nAbhidhamma, twelfth century CE). The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\ntradition preserves in Chinese translation three different recensions\nof an authoritative Abhidharma commentary or\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 dated to the first or second century\nCE, the last and best known of which is called the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101. The\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia document several centuries\nof scholarly activity representing multiple Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nbranches, most notably the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins of Kashmir who are\nknown as Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da manual most influential for later Chinese and\nTibetan Buddhism, however, is Vasubandhu\u2019s\nAbhidharmako\u015ba (Treasury of Abhidharma, fifth\ncentury CE). The Abhidharmako\u015ba\u2019s auto-commentary\ncontains substantial criticism of orthodox Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\npositions, which later Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nmasters attempted to refute. Particularly famous in this category is\nthe Ny\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra (Conformance to Correct\nPrinciple) of Sa\u1e45ghabhadra, a contemporary of Vasubandhu.\nThis comprehensive treatise reestablishes orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da views and is considered one of the final\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da works to have\n survived.[3] \nIn sum, the Abhidharma\/Abhidhamma texts are by and large compositions\ncontemporary with the formative period in the history of the early\nBuddhist schools, providing the means by which one group could define\nitself and defend its position against the divergent interpretations\nand criticisms of other parties. Although much of the Abhidharma\nmindset and something of its method draw on the\n\u0100gamas\/Nik\u0101yas, i.e., the collections of\ns\u016btras (Pali, suttas), the main body of its\nliterature contains interpretations of the Buddha\u2019s discourses\nspecific to each school of thought and philosophical elaborations of\nselectively emphasized doctrinal issues. These continued to be refined\nby subsequent generations of monks who contributed to the\nconsolidation of the two surviving Therav\u0101da and\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da schools."},"3":{"chunk_id":"1c5e1bb00fe5e63f3d85cf8ff2b02d84","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["1.

The majority of the\nsources are autobiographical passages in his works (especially\nMostrador de Justicia). Abner was born around 1260, probably\nin the Jewish community of Burgos, one of the major communities in\nCastile. While still Jewish, Abner worked as a book trader, a rabbi,\nand he may have been a physician as well. During this time he was the\nhead of a yeshiva (Jewish academy) in Burgos, but we do not know if\nthis yeshiva was a public institution or just a private group of\nstudents that met in his home. We know from a former pupil, Rabbi\nIsaac Pulgar, and from the sources that he utilizes in his works, that\nduring the Jewish period of his life, Abner was a philosopher, being a\npart of the Maimonidean-Averroist trend of Jewish philosophy at the\ntime. \nIn spite of the majority opinion of modern\n scholars,[1]\n Abner probably was not a Kabbalist before his conversion to\nChristianity. This mistake is based essentially on two sources: the\nfact that some of Abner\u2019s arguments for the Trinity and Incarnation\ncan be interpreted as deriving from Kabbalistic sources, and the\nexistence of another Rabbi Abner (not a common name for Jews of his\ntime), a Kabbalist whom Rabbi Isaac of Acre cited many times. In my\nopinion, Abner\u2019s argument for the Trinity and Incarnation is not based\non Kabbalistic sources, but stems from his Neo-Platonic and standard\nChristian scriptural\n background.[2]\n Additionally, Abner (the apostate) did not use many important\nKabbalistic\n sources.[3]\n His opinions are not the same as the other Rabbi Abner\u2019s (the one\nthat Rabbi Isaac of Acre quotes), and we can see that the two authors\ndo not share the same background, nor do they use the same sources,\nwith Abner utilizing almost entirely sources taken from the Jewish\nphilosophical and traditional rabbinic\n corpuses.[4]\n almost all of Rabbi Abner\u2019s sources are taken from the commentary of\nNahmanides to the Torah, a book that Abner the apostate almost never\nquoted.  \nThe beginning of Abner\u2019s doubts about Judaism began with the incident\nof a false messiah in Avila in 1295. According to Abner, the Jews of\nthe community, which is in North Castile, went outside the city to\nwelcome the messiah, but instead of the messiah they received a\nrainfall of crosses that stuck to their clothes. Some of the Jews who\nwitnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled\nin Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing\nexile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of\nfeeling ambivalent (i.e., around 1317) Abner wrote about his first\nrevelation in a\n dream.[5]\n In his dream he saw a man that told him to be \u201ca teacher of\nrighteousness\u201d (mostrador de justicia, not\ncoincidentally the name of Abner\u2019s main book) and to bring his people\nto freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the\nJewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream\nwherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the\nclothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the\nChristian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around\n1320\/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the\ncollegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation\nof Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the\nconclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be\nsaved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre\nand that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North\nCastile around 1336\u20131339. There was a public disputation between\nAbner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335\u20131336 on the\nsubject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates. This dispute\nwas the main reason for the decree against this part of the Jewish\nprayer (birkatha-minim) by Alfonso XI in 1336. Abner\nprobably died in 1347 or later."}},"2":{"0":{"chunk_id":"81e573a9d329de10a9651c19c4907dc2","article_title":"Abduction","section_path":["1.

In addition to events\nchronicled in the public record, his inner life is revealed in his\nautobiographical letter Historia calamitatum [\u201cThe\nStory of My Troubles\u201d] and in his famous correspondence with\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse. \nAbelard was born into the lesser nobility around 1079 in Le Pallet, a\nsmall town in Brittany near Nantes. He received early training in\nletters, and took to his studies with enthusiasm; his later writings\nshow familiarity with Cicero, Horace, Juvenal, Ovid, Lucan, Seneca,\nand Vergil. Abelard eventually renounced his inheritance, including\nits attendant knighthood, to pursue philosophy. He did so by\ntravelling to study with well-known philosophers, most notably\nRoscelin and William of Champeaux. \nDuring the first years of the twelfth century, Abelard felt confident\nenough to set himself up as a lecturer, first at Melun and then at\nCorbeil, competing mainly with William of Champeaux (Paris) for\nstudents and reputation. The strain proved too\nmuch\u2014Abelard\u2019s health failed, and he returned to Brittany\nfor several years. \nAbelard returned to Paris sometime between 1108 and 1113 with his\nhealth restored and his ambition intact. He attended William of\nChampeaux\u2019s lectures, and entered into debate with William over\nthe problem of universals. According to Abelard\u2019s report, he\nbested his teacher in debate, and gained his reputation as a\ndialectician of note, teaching at several schools. Around 1113 Abelard\ndecided to study theology; he sought out the most eminent teacher of\ntheology of his day, Anselm of Laon (not to be confused with Anselm of\nCanterbury), and became his student. It was not a good choice:\nAnselm\u2019s traditional methods did not appeal to Abelard, and,\nafter some back-and-forth, Abelard returned to Paris to continue on\nhis own. It would be the last time he studied with anyone. \nUpon returning to Paris, Abelard became scholar-in-residence at Notre\nDame, a position he held until his romantic entanglement with\nH\u00e9lo\u00efse led to his castration, at which point he entered\nthe Benedictine monastery of Saint Denis and H\u00e9lo\u00efse\nentered the convent of Argenteuil. After his recovery, Abelard resumed\nteaching at a nearby priory, primarily on theology and in particular\non the Trinity. His method of philosophical analysis was seen as a\ndirect challenge to more traditional approaches, and a synod, convened\nin Soissons to examine Abelard\u2019s writings, condemned them and\nrequired Abelard to make a public avowal of faith, an experience he\nfound humiliating; shortly afterwards he was allowed to settle in a\nwild and uninhabited section of land, to devote himself to\ncontemplation. \nIt was not to be. Abelard says that poverty forced him to resume\nteaching. He and the students who flocked to him in droves constructed\nan oratory named the Paraclete, where he continued to write, teach,\nand research. This idyll came to an end around 1126, when Abelard\naccepted an invitation to become abbot of the monastery of Saint\nGildas de Rhuys in Brittany; shortly afterwards he handed over the\nParaclete to H\u00e9lo\u00efse and the other nuns, whose convent had\nbeen expropriated. Abelard found the monks of Saint Gildas difficult\nand obstructive\u2014even dangerous\u2014and he claims that there\nwere several attempts on his life while in residence. During this\nperiod he wrote the Historia calamitatum and corresponded\nwith H\u00e9lo\u00efse. \nBy the mid-1130s Abelard was given permission to return to Paris\n(retaining his rank as abbot) and to teach in the schools on the Mont\nSte.-Genevieve. It was during this time that his theological treatises\nwere brought to the attention of Bernard of Clairvaux, who objected to\nsome of Abelard\u2019s conclusions as well as to his approach to\nmatters of faith. After some inconclusive attempts to resolve their\ndifferences, Abelard asked the archbishop of Sens to arrange a public\ndispute between himself and Bernard on 3 June 1140, to settle their\ndisagreements. Bernard initially refused the invitation on the grounds\nthat one should not debate matters of faith, but then accepted it and,\nunknown to Abelard, arranged to convene another commission of enquiry\nto review Abelard\u2019s works on suspicion of heresy. When Abelard\ndiscovered that there was no debate but instead a kangaroo court, he\nrefused to take part, announcing his intention to appeal to the Pope\ndirectly. He walked out of the proceedings and began travelling to\nRome. The Council condemned nineteen propositions it claimed to find\nin his works and adjourned. Bernard launched a successful campaign\npetitioning the Papal Court before Abelard was out of France; a letter\nfrom the Pope upholding the decision of the Council of Soissons\nreached Abelard while he was at Cluny; Abelard was ordered to silence.\nBy all accounts Abelard complied immediately, even meeting peacefully\nwith Bernard in reconciliation. Peter the Venerable, the abbot of\nCluny, wrote to the Pope about these matters, and the Pope lifted\nAbelard\u2019s sentence. Abelard remained under the protection of\nPeter the Venerable first at Cluny, then at St. Marcel, as his health\ngradually deteriorated. Abelard died on 21 April 1142. His body was\ninterred at the Paraclete, and today is (with H\u00e9lo\u00efse) in\nP\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in Paris. \nAbelard\u2019s students were active as kings, philosophers, poets,\npoliticians, theologians, and monks; they include three popes and\nseveral heads of state. Explicit references to Abelard\u2019s\nthinking in the later Middle Ages are few, likely because of the cloud\ncast by the verdict of the Council of Soissons, but it is clear that\nhe had a seminal influence on twelfth-century philosophy and perhaps\non later fourteenth-century speculation as well."},"2":{"chunk_id":"5e36bbe1f7a040a718fd69c017075ab8","article_title":"Abhidharma","section_path":["1.

One reason for this is that Abelard constantly revised and\nrewrote, so that several distinct versions of a given work might be in\ncirculation; another reason is that several of his writings might\nrepresent \u2018teaching notes\u2019 constantly evolving in courses\nand seminars. Hence it is not clear that \u2018date of\ncomposition\u2019 is a well-defined notion when applied to the body\nof Abelard\u2019s work that we now possess. Apart from\nAbelard\u2019s correspondence, which can be dated with relative\nprecision, Abelard\u2019s extant work falls into three\ncategories. \nThe first category consists of Abelard\u2019s works on\ndialectic\u2014works concerned with logic, philosophy of\nlanguage, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. His two masterworks\nare: \nBoth of these works follow the pattern of the logica vetus,\nthe \u201cold logic\u201d inherited from antiquity: Porphyry\u2019s\nintroduction to Aristotle, the Isagoge; Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and On Interpretation; Boethius\u2019s\nIntroduction to the Categorical Syllogism, Categorical\nSyllogisms, Hypothetical Syllogisms, On Topical\nDifference, and On Division. Abelard\u2019s works cover\nthe material presented in the old logic, though they do so in\ndifferent ways. His Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019 is a close textual commentary on\nthe old logic, though only some of it survives, namely the\ncommentaries on the Isagoge, the Categories, On\nInterpretation, and On Topical Differences; his\nDialectica is an independent treatise on dialectic that\ntreats the same material thematically, though neither the beginning\n(covering the Isagoge and the start of the\nCategories) nor the ending (on division and definition) have\nbeen preserved. In addition, there are four lesser works on\ndialectic: \nThe first of these is a series of elementary commentaries on the old\nlogic (though again not completely preserved); their simple level has\nled some scholars to think they must come from early in\nAbelard\u2019s career, others to deny that they are Abelard\u2019s\nwork at all. Second, the Logica \u2018nostrorum\npetitioni sociorum\u2019 is something of a work-in-progress: it\nassumes knowledge of Abelard\u2019s earlier Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019 and discusses advanced points\nnot dealt with there, but for long stretches it is also a\nstraightforward paraphrase of or commentary on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge; it has textual parallels with some of\nAbelard\u2019s other works and shows some knowledge of theology. The\nthird work deals with concepts, or \u2018understandings\u2019, from\nboth the point of view of logic (roughly as providing the meanings of\nterms) and from the point of view of the philosophy of mind (as\nvehicles for mental content). The last work may be no more than a\nreport of some of Abelard\u2019s lectures, and is concerned with\nlogical and metaphysical puzzles about wholes and parts. \nThe second category consists of Abelard\u2019s works on ethics: \nThe Ethics offers an analysis of moral worth and the degree\nof praise or blame that should attach to agents and their actions; it\nbreaks off at the beginning of the second book. The\nConversations is a pair of debates (among characters who\nappear to Abelard in a dream) over the nature of happiness and the\nsupreme good: the Philosopher, who claims to follow only natural\nreason, first debates with the Jew, who follows the Old Law; the\nPhilosopher then debates the Christian, who defends Christian ethics\nfrom a philosophical point of view. Abelard also wrote a slight work\nof practical advice for his son: \nMoral advice and edifying sentiments are found in this series of\ndistichs. \nThe third category consists of Abelard\u2019s works of philosophical\ntheology. His three main works are devoted to a philosophical analysis\nof the Trinity, the several versions representing successive stages of\nhis thought and his attempts at orthodoxy (each rewritten several\ntimes): \nThe first version of the Theology seems to have been the work\ncondemned at the Council of Soisssons, the last the work condemned at\nthe Council of Sens. In addition to these three works, in which\nproblems in philosophical theology are treated thematically, Abelard\nalso wrote several commentaries: \nThe first three commentaries are brief, but Abelard\u2019s\ndiscussions of the first verses of Genesis and of\nPaul\u2019s letter are extensive and detailed (the latter also\nrelevant to Abelard\u2019s ethical theory). Abelard also took up\nquestions about faith and reason in a short work: \nThis brief inner dialogue, modelled on Augustine\u2019s\nSoliloquies, has \u201cPeter\u201d talking things over with\n\u201cAbelard.\u201d Theological questions of a more practical\nnature were raised by H\u00e9lo\u00efse in a series of questions she\nasked on her behalf and on behalf of the nuns of the Paraclete: \nPractical issues are also addressed in Abelard\u2019s sermons, hymns,\nand lamentations (planctus). Finally, Abelard composed an\nextremely influential theological work that contains no theoretical\nspeculation at all: \nAbelard assembles a series of 158 questions, each of which is\nfurnished with patristic citations that imply a positive answer\n(sic) to the question and other patristic citations implying\na negative answer (non). Abelard does not attempt to\nharmonize these apparently inconsistent remarks, but in his preface he\nlays down rules for proper hermeneutic investigation: look for\nambiguity, check the surrounding context, draw relevant distinctions,\nand the like. \nAbelard\u2019s students and disciples also record many of his views,\nthough this material has yet to be explored carefully. There are\nreferences in Abelard\u2019s extant works to other works we do not\nhave: Grammatica, \u201cGrammar\u201d; Rhetorica,\n\u201cRhetoric\u201d; a commentary on Ezekiel written at\nthe beginning of his studies in theology; and others. It is possible\nsome of these works may yet be found."},"2":{"chunk_id":"cd72cc23f860fff086a59aaba4395a69","article_title":"Abhidharma","section_path":["1.

The number eighteen, though, became conventional\nin Buddhist historiography for symbolic and mnemonic reasons\n(Obeyesekere 1991) and, in fact, different Buddhist sources preserve\ndivergent lists of schools which sum up to more than eighteen. The\nlikelihood is that the early formative period of the Buddhist\ncommunity gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed\nspontaneously due to the geographical extension of the community over\nthe entire Indian subcontinent and subject to the particular problems\nthat confronted each monastic community (sa\u1e45gha). Each\nsa\u1e45gha tended to specialize in a specific branch of\nlearning, had its own practical customs and relations with lay\ncircles, and was influenced by the particular territories, economy,\nand use of language and dialect prevalent in its environment. Indeed,\nthe names of the \u201ceighteen schools\u201d are indicative of\ntheir origins in characteristic doctrines, geographical locations, or\nthe legacy of particular founders: for instance,\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that all\nthings exist\u201d), Sautr\u0101ntikas (\u201cthose who rely on the\ns\u016btras\u201d)\/D\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ntikas\n(\u201cthose who employ\n examples\u201d),[1]\n and Pudgalav\u0101da (\u201cthose who affirm the existence of the\nperson\u201d); Haimavatas (\u201cthose of the snowy\nmountains\u201d); or V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas (\u201cthose\naffiliated with V\u0101ts\u012bputra\u201d) respectively. As noted by\nGethin (1998, 52), rather than sects or denominations as in\nChristianity, \u201cat least some of the schools mentioned by later\nBuddhist tradition are likely to have been informal schools of thought\nin the manner of \u2018Cartesians,\u2019 \u2018British\nEmpiricists,\u2019 or \u2018Kantians\u2019 for the history of\nmodern\n philosophy.\u201d[2]"},"3":{"chunk_id":"adc402e42ed88892ace9243af4bf452e","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["1.

They are\nlike abilities in many significant respects, in particular in the fact\nthat they are properties of things that can exist even when not\nmanifested: as a glass may be fragile even when it is not broken, so\nmay a person have the ability to raise her arm even when she is not\nraising her arm. \nWhile dispositions have been central to contemporary philosophical\ndiscussions, they do not exhaust the range of the possibilities\ninherent in things. Especially notable, for present purposes, are\nthose that are intimately connected to agency. These include the\nsusceptibility of things to be acted on in certain ways \u2014 such\nas the edibility of an apple, or the walkability of a trail \u2014\nthat the psychologist J.J. Gibson called affordances (Gibson, 1979).\nThese include also the powers of action that we ascribe to things, of\nthe kind observed by Thomas Reid: \u2018Thus we say, the wind blows,\nthe sea rages, the sun rises and sets, bodies gravitate and\nmove\u2019 (Reid 1788\/2010, 16; Reid himself regarded these locutions\nas \"misapplications\" of active verbs, based on erroneous\nviews of the grounds of powers). Finally, and crucially, these include\nthe powers of agents themselves. \nIn light of this ontological diversity, it will be useful to have a\nterm that encompasses all the possibilities inherent in things and in\nagents. Let us reserve the word \u2018power\u2019 for that general\nclass. Dispositions, as defined above, are a proper subset of powers\nmore generally. Affordances, as sketched above, are another one. And\nabilities, in a sense still to be defined, are yet another. \nIt may yet be that dispositions are especially privileged among the\npowers. For instance, they might be more fundamental than the other\npowers, in the sense that other powers may be reduced to them. It has\nbeen proposed, for instance, that affordances may be reduced to\ndispositions (Scarantino 2003). And we will consider in some detail,\nin Section 5.1, the proposal that abilities themselves may be reduced\nto dispositions. But our initial hypothesis is that dispositions are\nsimply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has\nreceived a great measure of attention in the philosophical\nliterature."},"4":{"chunk_id":"75479525ae2d3e3c9790c2fa643f7d37","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["1.

Metaphysics"],"chunk_type":"section","philosophers":["Peter Abelard","Abelard","Bernard of Clairvaux","Socrates"],"concepts":["Aristotle","H\u00e9lo\u00efse","Latin"],"content":"\nAbelard\u2019s metaphysics is the first great example of nominalism\nin the Western tradition. While his view that universals are mere\nwords (nomina) justifies the label, nominalism\u2014or,\nbetter, irrealism\u2014is the hallmark of Abelard\u2019s entire\nmetaphysics. He is an irrealist not only about universals, but also\nabout propositions, events, times other than the present, natural\nkinds, relations, wholes, absolute space, hylomorphic composites, and\nthe like. Instead, Abelard holds that the concrete individual, in all\nits richness and variety, is more than enough to populate the world.\nAbelard preferred reductive, atomist, and material explanations\nwhenever possible; he devoted a great deal of effort to pouring cold\nwater on the metaphysical excesses of his predecessors and\ncontemporaries. \nAbelard defends his thesis that universals are nothing but words by\narguing that ontological realism about universals is incoherent. More\nexactly, he holds that there cannot be any real object in the world\nsatisfying Boethius\u2019s criteria for the universal, namely\nsomething present as a whole in many at once so as to constitute their\nsubstance (i.e. to make the individual in which it is present what it\nis). Hence, Abelard concludes, universality is not an ontological\nfeature of the world but a semantic feature of language. \nSuppose universals were things in the world, so that one and the same\nitem is completely present in both Socrates and an ass at the same\ntime, making each to be wholly an animal. Abelard points out that then\nthe same thing, animal, will be simultaneously rational (due\nto its role in constituting the species human being) and\nirrational (due to its role in constituting the species ass).\nBut then contraries are simultaneously present in the same thing as a\nwhole, which is impossible. \nTo the rejoinder that rationality and irrationality are not actually\npresent in the same thing, Abelard offers a twofold reply. First, he\nrejects the claim that they are present only potentially. Each species\nis actually informed by a contrary, and the genus is actually present\nin each as a whole; hence it is actually informed by one contrary in\none species and by the other in the other; since it is wholly one and\nthe same in each, it is therefore actually informed by contraries, and\nthe contradiction results. Second, Abelard undertakes to establish\nthat contraries will be present not merely in the genus but even in\nthe selfsame individual. For Socrates is (an) animal, and so is\nBrunellus the Ass; but by transitivity\u2014since each is wholly and\ncompletely animal\u2014Socrates is Brunellus, and hence both\nrational and irrational. Put a different way, each is essentially an\nanimal, and furthermore essentially rational and essentially\nirrational. \nIf we object to this last piece of reasoning, on the grounds that\nindividuals are unique in virtue of their non-essential features,\nAbelard replies that this view \u201cmakes accidents prior to\nsubstance.\u201d That is, the objection claims that individual things\nare individual in virtue of features that contingently characterize\nthem, which confuses things with their features. \nProspects are no better for realism if the universal is identified not\nwith a single thing but with a collection of things. Abelard points\nout that collections are posterior to their parts, and, furthermore,\nthe collection is not shared among its parts in the way a universal is\nsaid to be common to many. Nor does it help to try to identify the\nuniversal with the individual in some fashion, for example in claiming\nthat Socrates qua human is taken as the universal human\nbeing; Abelard argues that if the universal really is the\nindividual, then we are stuck with the consequence that either\nindividuals such as Socrates are common to many, or there are as many\nuniversals as there are individuals, each of which is absurd. \nAbelard concludes that universality is merely linguistic, not a\nfeature of the world. More precisely, Abelard holds that common nouns\n(such as \u2018animal\u2019), verbs, and negative names (such as\n\u2018not-Socrates\u2019) are correctly predicable of many, and so\ncount as universals. These terms are semantically general, in that\ntheir sense applies to more than one thing, but they do not thereby\nname some general thing; instead, they distributively refer to each of\nthe individuals to which the term applies. For example, the term\n\u2018animal\u2019 has the sense living substance, which is\ninherently general, and it refers to each individual animal since each\nis a living substance\u2014as Abelard puts it, since each has the\nstatus of being a living substance. But this is to leave the domain of\nmetaphysics for semantics; see the discussion of Abelard\u2018s\nphilosophy of language in\n Section 4. \nAbelard maintains that everything in the world apart from God and\nangels is either form, matter, or a composite of form and matter. The\nmatter of something is that out of which it is made, whether it\npersists in the finished product (as bricks in a house) or is absorbed\ninto it (as flour in bread). Ultimately, all material objects are\ncomposed of the four elements earth, air, fire, and water, but they do\nnot retain their elemental forms in most combinations. In general, the\nform of a material object just is the configuration of its material\nparts: \u201cWe call the form strictly what comes from the\ncomposition of the parts.\u201d The form of a statue, for example, is\nits shape, which is no more than the arrangement of its\nmatter\u2014the curve of the nose, the size of the eyes, and so on.\nForms are therefore supervenient on matter, and have no\nontological standing independent of it. This is not to deny that forms\nexist, but to provide a particular explanation of what it is for a\nform to inhere in a given subject, namely for that subject to have its\nmatter configured in a certain way. For example, the inherence of\nshape in the statue just is the way in which its bronze is arranged.\nHence material things are identical with what they are made\nof\u2014with one exception: human beings, whose forms are their\nimmaterial (and immortal) souls. Strictly speaking, since human souls\nare capable of existence in separation form the body, they are not\nforms after all, though they act as substantial forms as long as they\nare joined to the body. \nMaterial composites of form and matter, humans excepted, are integral\nwholes made up of their discrete material parts as configured in a\ngiven way. Abelard countenances many types of integral wholes:\ncollections, no matter how their members are selected; structured\ncomposites, whether naturally unified (such as Socrates and his limbs)\nor artificially unified (such as the walls, floor, and roof of a\nhouse); continuous quantities that are homogeneous material\n\u2018substances,\u2019 namely stuffs, such as water or gold;\ngeometrical objects, such as lines, defined by the relative position\nof their parts; temporal wholes, such as a day and the hours that make\nit up. Most of these wholes are ontologically nothing beyond their\nmaterial parts. Whether structured composites have any independent\nontological standing depends on the status of their organizing\nforms. \nAbelard\u2019s theory of substantial integral wholes is not a pure\nmereology in the modern sense, since he holds that there are\nprivileged divisions: just as a genus is properly divided into not\njust any species but its proximate species, so too the division of a\nwhole must be into its principal parts. Intuitively, some wholes have\na natural division that takes precedence over others; a sentence, for\nexample, is divided into words, syllables, and letters, in precisely\nthat order. According to Abelard, the principal parts of a whole are\nthose whose conjunction immediately results in the complete whole. His\nintent seems to be that the nature of the composition (if any) that\ndefines the integral whole also spells out its principal parts. A\nhouse consists of floor, walls, and roof put together in the right\nway. It is an open question whether each principal part (such as the\nwall) requires the existence of all of its subparts (every brick). The\nprincipal parts of a collection, for example, are just each of the\nmembers of the collection, whatever may be the case with any given\nmember\u2019s subparts; the principal parts of an aggregation are the\nmembers located in proximity to one another. \nIndividuals have natures, and in virtue of their natures they belong\nto determinate natural kinds. But an individual\u2019s nature is not\nsomething really shared with or common to other individuals;\nAbelard\u2019s refutation of realism has shown that this is\nimpossible. Instead, Abelard takes a natural kind to be a well-defined\ncollection of things that have the same features, broadly speaking,\nthat make them what they are. Why a given thing has some features\nrather than others is explained by how it got that way\u2014the\nnatural processes that created it result in its having the features it\ndoes, namely being the kind of thing it is; similar processes lead to\nsimilar results. On this reading, it is clear that natural kinds have\nno special status; they are no more than discrete integral wholes\nwhose principle of membership is similarity, merely reflecting the\nfact that the world is divided into discrete similarity-classes of\nobjects. Furthermore, such real relations of similarity are nothing\nthemselves above and beyond the things that are similar. The division\ninto natural kinds is, presumably, a \u2018shallow fact\u2019 about\nthe world: matters could have been otherwise had God ordained them\ndifferently; fire might be cold, heavy bodies fall upwards, frogs\nreason. If these causal powers were different, then natural kinds\nmight be different as well, or might not have been as sharply\ndifferentiated as they are now.

A taxonomy","1.2 Demarcating abilities"],"chunk_type":"subsection","philosophers":["van Inwagen"],"concepts":["Sections 3\u20135","French","Major League"],"content":"\nAbilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely,\nis an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two\nadditional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an\nability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects.\nAbilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not\nagents. Objects have dispositions and affordances \u2014 as a glass\nis disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid\n\u2014 but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is\nnot, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is\nbecause agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second,\nabilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate\nagents to actions. \nSome examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some\npowers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any\nrelation to action. Consider the power of understanding language.\nUnderstanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational,\nis not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus\nthe power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present\ntaxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability,\nsince it involves a relation to action. (See van Inwagen 1983,\n8\u201313.) \nSo, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that\nrelates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities,\nwhile serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it\ninherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between\nactions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain\nof action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem\nthat, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible\nthat the domain of action will be vague, so that there are\nsome events that are not definitely actions, but that are not\ndefinitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about\naction apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is\nright, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in\nterms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and\nvague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the\ntheory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For\ngiving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on\nparadigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of\nability. \nNote there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as\ndistinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active\npowers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the\nwill (Reid 1788\/2000). But it is not clear that these distinctions\noverlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be\nan active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability,\nfor the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question\nof whether willing is itself an action."},"4":{"chunk_id":"ce302e8d53ead5681a854e0f3afd29e5","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["1.

Some of the Jews who\nwitnessed the miracle went to Abner for advice. This event instilled\nin Abner some doubts about the question of the reason for the ongoing\nexile of Israel and the truth of Judaism. After twenty-two years of\nfeeling ambivalent (i.e., around 1317) Abner wrote about his first\nrevelation in a\n dream.[5]\n In his dream he saw a man that told him to be \u201ca teacher of\nrighteousness\u201d (mostrador de justicia, not\ncoincidentally the name of Abner\u2019s main book) and to bring his people\nto freedom from exile. This dream just accents the uncertainty of the\nJewish Rabbi. After three more years of studies he had a second dream\nwherein he had the same revelation, this time noticing that on the\nclothes the man wore were crosses like the cross of Jesus the\nChristian. This dream prompted him toward his final conversion around\n1320\/1321. After his conversion, Abner became the sacristan of the\ncollegiate church of Valladolid and devoted himself to the propagation\nof Christianity amongst his former fellows Jews (he had come to the\nconclusion that conversion to Christianity was the only way to be\nsaved from the Exile). We know he wrote an extended polemicist oeuvre\nand that he took part in the anti-Jewish polemic effort in North\nCastile around 1336\u20131339. There was a public disputation between\nAbner and a rabbi that occurred probably around 1335\u20131336 on the\nsubject of the prayer of the Jews against the apostates.

This supposition,\nwhich we may call the Rylean account of know how (since it is\nmost explicitly defended in Ryle 1949, 25\u201361), has been called\ninto question by Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (Stanley and\nWilliamson 2001). Let us briefly consider Stanley and Williamson\u2019s\nargument and how it bears on the theory of ability. \nStanley and Williamson argue, on broadly linguistic grounds, that our\ndefault view of know how ought to be rather different from Ryle\u2019s.\nPart of the argument for this is that standard treatments of embedded\nquestions (\u2018know who\u2019, \u2018know where\u2019, and so\nforth; see Karttunen 1977) suggest a rather different treatment. On\nthis treatment, to know how to A is to know a certain\nproposition. At first pass, in Stanley and Williamson\u2019s\npresentation, for S to know how to A is for\nS to know, of some contextually relevant way of acting\nw, that w is a way for S to A.\nStanley and Williamson develop and defend such a treatment, and offer\nindependent considerations for rejecting Ryle\u2019s own arguments for\nthe Rylean view. On their view, then, to know how to A is\nnot to have an ability. \nStanley and Williamson\u2019s arguments are far from widely accepted\n(see No\u00eb 2005), but they tell at the very least against simply\nassuming that an account of ability will also be an account\nof know how. So we will leave questions of know how to one side in\nwhat follows. It is also reasonable to hope that an account of\nability, while it may not simply be an account of know how,\nwill at least shed light on disputes about know how. For so long as we\nlack a theory of what an ability is, the precise content of the Rylean\nview (and of its denial) remains unclear. So it may be that getting\nclear on abilities may help us, perhaps indirectly, to get clear on\nknow how as well. (Additional discussion of these questions may be\nfound in Stanley\u2019s book-length development of his and\nWilliamson\u2019s initial position (Stanley 2011), as well as the\npapers collected in (Bengson and Moffett 2011). \nWhatever our view of ability and know how, there is a further question\nat the intersection of these topics that bears consideration. This is\nhow to accommodate those powers of agents that appear to be especially\nclosely connected to practical intelligence, such as skills and\ntalents \u2014 which we might collectively call the intelligent\npowers. Are the intelligent powers simply a species of ability,\nor do they demand an independent treatment? There are a number of\nrecent proposals to be considered here. (Robb forthcoming) proposes a\ndispositionalist theory of talent, on which a talent is a disposition\nto maintain and develop a skill. (McGeer 2018) emphasizes the\nsignificance of a distinctive kind of intelligent power, which she\n(following Ryle) calls an \u2018intelligent capacity,\u2019 and of\nwhich she too offers a broadly dispositionalist account. These\nproposals suggest a more general program of dispositionalism about the\nintelligent powers, which has suggestive parallels to the\ndispositionalism about ability that we will consider in Section 5.1.\nStill more generally, accurately accounting for the nature of the\nintelligent powers, and the relationship of these to abilities and to\nthe powers more generally, remains an open and intriguing problem."},"4":{"chunk_id":"a97813e721ae4369cef3eca6b7d4d31e","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["2.

The book starts with a\nbrief introduction wherein Abner writes about the reasons for his\nconversion (the incident in Avila and his two dreams). The main part\nof the book is a debate between a Christian (the master) and a Jew\n(the rebel). In contrast to other works similar to this type of\npolemic debate, in the Mostrador, the rebel does not become a\nChristian, and despite his losing the debate, the Jew continues to\nbelieve in his ostensibly false religion. The book is divided into ten\nchapters, with each chapter being subdivided into a number of\nparagraphs. Each paragraph is a speech by one of the protagonists of\nthe\n debate.[6] \nSummary of the chapters: \nResponses to the Blasphemer (Teshuvot la-Meharef): this book\nsurvived both in the original\n Hebrew[7]\n and in a Castilian\n translation.[8]\n This book is a response to the different letters that Abner\u2019s only\nknown student, Rabbi Isaac Pulgar, wrote against his determinist and\nChristian\n writings.[9]\n Abner did not divide this book into formal sections, though the book\ncontains four main subjects presented in a contiguous fashion: (1) an\nintroduction wherein Abner attacks his former pupil on his\nphilosophical position and other personal matters between the two; (2)\nthe Trinity and how it can be based on philosophy, scripture and\nquotes from the Jewish rabbinic literature; (3) the necessary\nexistence of the incarnation of divinity in the world; and (4) a proof\nof the aforementioned Christian beliefs derived from scripture and\nother Jewish sources (Talmud and Midrashim). In this last part, which\ntakes up almost half the book, Abner argues that the messiah had\nalready come and that Christianity is true. \nWhile Abner\u2019s arguments regarding the Trinity and Incarnation are\ngenerally more developed in Mostradorde Justicia,\nthe philosophical importance of this work resides with his critique of\nthe Jewish philosopher. Here Abner distinguishes between the regular\nJewish people (that have some hope to become Christian and to be\nsaved) and Jewish philosophers (like Pulgar). The latter are hopeless\nand are left with no religion, mostly due to their opinions that only\nthe people who attain scientific knowledge have some kind of existence\nafter death. Due to their feeling elevated over others, these\nphilosophers have no hope of improving and accepting the truth of\nChristianity. Parts of Abner\u2019s critique of Jewish philosophers in this\nbook most probably influenced Crescas. \nLibro de la Ley (Book of the Law). This work\nsurvived only\n fragmentally[10]\n in Castilian. The major argument of Abner in this book is that the\nJewish people forgot the secrets of the Torah, which are manifested by\nthe Christian doctrines, especially the Trinity. \nSefer Teshuvot ha-Meshubot (The Book of Responses to the\nApostasies) exists only in\n Hebrew.[11]\n There are three polemic\n letters[12]\n that deal especially with scriptural arguments on the subject of the\ncoming of the\n messiah.[13]"}},"6":{"0":{"chunk_id":"6c943762de83a112fe91d3de929913e8","article_title":"Abduction","section_path":["1.

The\ndistinction between deduction, on the one hand, and induction and\nabduction, on the other hand, corresponds to the distinction between\nnecessary and non-necessary inferences. In deductive inferences, what\nis inferred is necessarily true if the premises from which it\nis inferred are true; that is, the truth of the premises\nguarantees the truth of the conclusion. A familiar type of\nexample is inferences instantiating the schema \nAll As are Bs.\n\na is an A.\n\nHence, a is a B.\n \nBut not all inferences are of this variety. Consider, for instance,\nthe inference of \u201cJohn is rich\u201d from \u201cJohn lives in\nChelsea\u201d and \u201cMost people living in Chelsea are\nrich.\u201d Here, the truth of the first sentence is not guaranteed\n(but only made likely) by the joint truth of the second and third\nsentences. Differently put, it is not necessarily the case that if the\npremises are true, then so is the conclusion: it is logically\ncompatible with the truth of the premises that John is a member of the\nminority of non-rich inhabitants of Chelsea. The case is similar\nregarding your inference to the conclusion that Tim and Harry are\nfriends again on the basis of the information that they have been seen\njogging together. Perhaps Tim and Harry are former business partners\nwho still had some financial matters to discuss, however much they\nwould have liked to avoid this, and decided to combine this with their\ndaily exercise; this is compatible with their being firmly decided\nnever to make up. \nIt is standard practice to group non-necessary inferences into\ninductive and abductive ones. Inductive inferences\nform a somewhat heterogeneous class, but for present purposes they may\nbe characterized as those inferences that are based purely on\nstatistical data, such as observed frequencies of occurrences of a\nparticular feature in a given population. An example of such an\ninference would be this: \n96 per cent of the Flemish college students speak both Dutch and\nFrench.\n\nLouise is a Flemish college student.\n\nHence, Louise speaks both Dutch and French.\n \nHowever, the relevant statistical information may also be more vaguely\ngiven, as in the premise, \u201cMost people living in Chelsea are\nrich.\u201d (There is much discussion about whether the conclusion of\nan inductive argument can be stated in purely qualitative terms or\nwhether it should be a quantitative one\u2014for instance, that it\nholds with a probability of .96 that Louise speaks both Dutch and\nFrench\u2014or whether it can sometimes be stated in\nqualitative terms\u2014for instance, if the probability that it is\ntrue is high enough\u2014and sometimes not. On these and other issues\nrelated to induction, see Kyburg 1990 (Ch. 4). It should also be\nmentioned that Harman (1965) conceives induction as a special type of\nabduction. See also Weintraub 2013 for discussion.) \nThe mere fact that an inference is based on statistical data is not\nenough to classify it as an inductive one. You may have observed many\ngray elephants and no non-gray ones, and infer from this that all\nelephants are gray, because that would provide the best\nexplanation for why you have observed so many gray elephants\nand no non-gray ones. This would be an instance of an\nabductive inference. It suggests that the best way to distinguish\nbetween induction and abduction is this: both are ampliative,\nmeaning that the conclusion goes beyond what is (logically) contained\nin the premises (which is why they are non-necessary inferences), but\nin abduction there is an implicit or explicit appeal to explanatory\nconsiderations, whereas in induction there is not; in induction, there\nis only an appeal to observed frequencies or statistics. (I\nemphasize \u201conly,\u201d because in abduction there may also be\nan appeal to frequencies or statistics, as the example about the\nelephants exhibits.) \nA noteworthy feature of abduction, which it shares with induction but\nnot with deduction, is that it violates monotonicity, meaning\nthat it may be possible to infer abductively certain conclusions from\na subset of a set S of premises which cannot be\ninferred abductively from S as a whole. For instance, adding\nthe premise that Tim and Harry are former business partners who still\nhave some financial matters to discuss, to the premises that they had\na terrible row some time ago and that they were just seen jogging\ntogether may no longer warrant you to infer that they are friends\nagain, even if\u2014let us suppose\u2014the last two premises alone\ndo warrant that inference. The reason is that what counts as the best\nexplanation of Tim and Harry\u2019s jogging together in light of the\noriginal premises may no longer do so once the information has been\nadded that they are former business partners with financial matters to\ndiscuss."},"1":{"chunk_id":"993c0d0f8055a269447b8b872dd50614","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["2.

Sometimes our reliance on\nabductive reasoning is quite obvious and explicit. But in some daily\npractices, it may be so routine and automatic that it easily goes\nunnoticed. A case in point may be our trust in other people\u2019s\ntestimony, which has been said to rest on abductive reasoning; see\nHarman 1965, Adler 1994, Fricker 1994, and Lipton 1998 for defenses of\nthis claim. For instance, according to Jonathan Adler (1994, 274f),\n\u201c[t]he best explanation for why the informant asserts that\nP is normally that \u2026 he believes it for duly responsible\nreasons and \u2026 he intends that I shall believe it too,\u201d\nwhich is why we are normally justified in trusting the\ninformant\u2019s testimony. This may well be correct, even though in\ncoming to trust a person\u2019s testimony one does not normally seem\nto be aware of any abductive reasoning going on in one\u2019s mind.\nSimilar remarks may apply to what some hold to be a further, possibly\neven more fundamental, role of abduction in linguistic practice, to\nwit, its role in determining what a speaker means by an utterance.\nSpecifically, it has been argued that decoding utterances is a matter\nof inferring the best explanation of why someone said what he or she\nsaid in the context in which the utterance was made. Even more\nspecifically, authors working in the field of pragmatics have\nsuggested that hearers invoke the Gricean maxims of conversation to\nhelp them work out the best explanation of a speaker\u2019s utterance\nwhenever the semantic content of the utterance is insufficiently\ninformative for the purposes of the conversation, or is too\ninformative, or off-topic, or implausible, or otherwise odd or\ninappropriate; see, for instance, Bach and Harnish 1979 (92f), Dascal\n1979 (167), and Hobbs 2004. As in cases of reliance on speaker\ntestimony, the requisite abductive reasoning would normally seem to\ntake place at a subconscious level. \nAbductive reasoning is not limited to everyday contexts. Quite the\ncontrary: philosophers of science have argued that abduction is a\ncornerstone of scientific methodology; see, for instance, Boyd 1981,\n1984, Harr\u00e9 1986, 1988, Lipton 1991, 2004, and Psillos 1999.\nAccording to Timothy Williamson (2007), \u201c[t]he abductive\nmethodology is the best science provides\u201d and Ernan McMullin\n(1992) even goes so far to call abduction \u201cthe inference that\nmakes science.\u201d To illustrate the use of abduction in science,\nwe consider two examples. \nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was discovered that the\norbit of Uranus, one of the seven planets known at the time, departed\nfrom the orbit as predicted on the basis of Isaac Newton\u2019s\ntheory of universal gravitation and the auxiliary assumption that\nthere were no further planets in the solar system. One possible\nexplanation was, of course, that Newton\u2019s theory is false. Given\nits great empirical successes for (then) more than two centuries, that\ndid not appear to be a very good explanation. Two astronomers, John\nCouch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, instead suggested (independently of\neach other but almost simultaneously) that there was an eighth, as yet\nundiscovered planet in the solar system; that, they thought, provided\nthe best explanation of Uranus\u2019 deviating orbit. Not much later,\nthis planet, which is now known as \u201cNeptune,\u201d was\ndiscovered. \nThe second example concerns what is now commonly regarded to have been\nthe discovery of the electron by the English physicist Joseph John\nThomson. Thomson had conducted experiments on cathode rays in order to\ndetermine whether they are streams of charged particles. He concluded\nthat they are indeed, reasoning as follows: \n\n\nAs the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are\ndeflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively\nelectrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in\nwhich this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving\nalong the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion\nthat they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of\nmatter. (Thomson, cited in Achinstein 2001, 17)\n \nThe conclusion that cathode rays consist of negatively charged\nparticles does not follow logically from the reported experimental\nresults, nor could Thomson draw on any relevant statistical data. That\nnevertheless he could \u201csee no escape from the conclusion\u201d\nis, we may safely assume, because the conclusion is the best\u2014in\nthis case presumably even the only plausible\u2014explanation of his\nresults that he could think of. \nMany other examples of scientific uses of abduction have been\ndiscussed in the literature; see, for instance, Harr\u00e9 1986,\n1988 and Lipton 1991, 2004. Abduction is also said to be the\npredominant mode of reasoning in medical diagnosis: physicians tend to\ngo for the hypothesis that best explains the patient\u2019s symptoms\n(see Josephson and Josephson (eds.) 1994, 9\u201312; see also\nDragulinescu 2016 on abductive reasoning in the context of\nmedicine). \nLast but not least, abduction plays a central role in some important\nphilosophical debates. See Shalkowski 2010 on the place of abduction\nin metaphysics (also Bigelow 2010), Krzy\u017canowska, Wenmackers, and\nDouven 2014 and Douven 2016a for a possible role of\nabduction in the semantics of conditionals, and Williamson\n2017 for an application of abduction in the philosophy of logic.\nArguably, however, abduction plays its most notable philosophical role\nin epistemology and in the philosophy of science, where it is\nfrequently invoked in objections to so-called underdetermination\narguments. Underdetermination arguments generally start from the\npremise that a number of given hypotheses are empirically equivalent,\nwhich their authors take to mean that the evidence\u2014indeed, any\nevidence we might ever come to possess\u2014is unable to favor one of\nthem over the others. From this, we are supposed to conclude that one\ncan never be warranted in believing any particular one of the\nhypotheses. (This is rough, but it will do for present purposes; see\nDouven 2008 and Stanford 2009, for more detailed accounts of\nunderdetermination arguments.) A famous instance of this type of\nargument is the Cartesian argument for global skepticism, according to\nwhich the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we\ncustomarily deem it to be is empirically equivalent to a variety of\nso-called skeptical hypotheses (such as that we are beguiled by an\nevil demon, or that we are brains in a vat, connected to a\nsupercomputer; see, e.g., Folina 2016). Similar arguments have been\ngiven in support of scientific antirealism, according to which it will\nnever be warranted for us to choose between empirically equivalent\nrivals concerning what underlies the observable part of reality (van\nFraassen 1980). \nResponses to these arguments typically point to the fact that the\nnotion of empirical equivalence at play unduly neglects explanatory\nconsiderations, for instance, by defining the notion strictly in terms\nof hypotheses\u2019 making the same predictions. Those responding\nthen argue that even if some hypotheses make exactly the same\npredictions, one of them may still be a better explanation of the\nphenomena predicted. Thus, if explanatory considerations have a role\nin determining which inferences we are licensed to make\u2014as\naccording to defenders of abduction they have\u2014then we might\nstill be warranted in believing in the truth (or probable truth, or\nsome such, depending\u2014as will be seen below\u2014on the version\nof abduction one assumes) of one of a number of hypotheses that all\nmake the same predictions. Following Bertrand Russell (1912, Ch. 2),\nmany epistemologists have invoked abduction in arguing against\nCartesian skepticism, their key claim being that even though, by\nconstruction, the skeptical hypotheses make the same predictions as\nthe hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we ordinarily take\nit to be, they are not equally good explanations of what they predict;\nin particular, the skeptical hypotheses have been said to be\nconsiderably less simple than the \u201cordinary world\u201d\nhypothesis. See, among many others, Harman 1973 (Chs. 8 and 11),\nGoldman 1988 (205), Moser 1989 (161), and Vogel 1990, 2005; see\nPargetter 1984 for an abductive response specifically to skepticism\nregarding other minds. Similarly, philosophers of science have argued\nthat we are warranted to believe in Special Relativity Theory as\nopposed to Lorentz\u2019s version of the \u00e6ther theory. For even\nthough these theories make the same predictions, the former is\nexplanatorily superior to the latter. (Most arguments that have been\ngiven for this claim come down to the contention that Special\nRelativity Theory is ontologically more parsimonious than its\ncompetitor, which postulates the existence of an \u00e6ther. See\nJanssen 2002 for an excellent discussion of the various reasons\nphilosophers of science have adduced for preferring Einstein\u2019s\ntheory to Lorentz\u2019s.)"},"1":{"chunk_id":"189ba0b21b28b6973d4fd36d98965734","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["2.

First, taking\nabhi in the sense of \u201cwith regard to,\u201d\nabhidharma is understood as a discipline whose subject matter\nis the Dharma, the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Second, using\nabhi in the sense of preponderance and distinction,\nabhidharma has also been deemed a distinct, higher teaching;\nthe essence of the Buddha\u2019s teachings or that which goes beyond\nwhat is given in the Buddha\u2019s discourses, in a sense somewhat\nreminiscent of the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d (e.g.,\nDhs-a 2\u20133; Horner 1941; von Hin\u00fcber 1994).\nBuddhist tradition itself differentiates between the\nS\u016btr\u0101nta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings\nby contrasting the S\u016btr\u0101nta \u201cway of putting\nthings\u201d in partial, figurative terms that require further\nclarification, versus the Abhidharma exposition and catechism that\nexpound the teachings fully, in non-figurative terms (A IV\n449\u2013456; Dhs-a 154). This coincides with additional\ndistinctions the tradition makes between texts that have implicit\nmeaning (Skt., ney\u0101rtha, Pali, neyyattha)\nversus those that have explicit meaning (Skt.,\nn\u012bt\u0101rtha, Pali n\u012btattha) (A\nI 60; Ps I 18), and texts that are expressed in conventional\nterms (Skt., sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti, Pali, sammuti)\nversus others that are expressed in ultimate terms (Skt.,\nparam\u0101rtha, Pali, paramattha) (Vibh\n100\u2013101; Mp I\n 94\u201397).[4]\n From Abhidharma perspective, the s\u016btras were conveyed\nin conventional terms whose ultimate meaning required further\ninterpretation. \nThe texts of the canonical Abhidharma are works that evolved over\ndecades, if not centuries, out of materials already present in the\nS\u016btra and Vinaya portions of the canon. This is evidenced in two\ncharacteristics of the genre that can be traced to earlier Buddhist\nliterature. The first is the analytical style of the texts, which\nattempt to summarize meticulously the significant points of the Dharma\nand provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the mental and physical\nfactors that constitute sentient experience. This analytical\nenterprise includes the arrangement of major parts of the material\naround detailed lists of factors and combinations of sets of their\ncategories yielding matrices (Skt., m\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101,\nPali, m\u0101tik\u0101) of doctrinal topics. Already in the\ncollections of the Buddha\u2019s discourses, certain texts are\narranged according to taxonomic lists, providing formulaic treatment\nof doctrinal items that are expounded elsewhere. Lists were clearly\npowerful mnemonic devices, and their prevalence in early Buddhist\nliterature can be explained partly as a consequence of its being\ncomposed and for some centuries preserved\n orally.[5]\n For instance, one of the four primary \u0100gamas\/Nik\u0101yas, the\ncollection of \u201cgrouped\u201d sayings\n(sa\u1e43yukta\/sa\u1e43yutta), groups the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings according to specific topics, including the four noble\ntruths, the four ways of establishing mindfulness, the five\naggregates, the six sense faculties, the seven constituents of\nawakening, the noble eightfold path, the twelve links of dependent\norigination, and others. Similar taxonomic lists form the table of\ncontents of the Vibha\u1e45ga and\nPuggalapa\u00f1\u00f1atti of the Therav\u0101da and the\nSa\u1e45g\u012btipary\u0101ya and Dharmaskandha of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, which are structured as commentaries on\nthose lists. \nThe second characteristic of Abhidharma literature is its bent for\ndiscursive hermeneutics through catechetical exposition. The texts\nseem to be the products of discussions about the doctrine within the\nearly Buddhist community. Again, such discussions are already found in\nthe \u0100gama\/Nik\u0101ya collections (e.g., M I\n292\u2013305, III 202\u2013257): they often begin with a doctrinal\npoint to be clarified and proceed to expound the topic at stake using\na pedagogical method of question and answer. The texts also record\nmore formal methods of argumentation and refutation of rival theories\nthat shed light on the evolution of the Abhidharma as responding to\nthe demands of an increasingly polemical environment. The process of\ninstitutionalization undergone by Buddhist thought at the time and the\nspread of the Buddhist community across the Indian subcontinent\ncoincided with a transition from oral to written methods of textual\ntransmission and with the rise of monastic debates concerning the\ndoctrine among the various Buddhist schools. Intellectual assimilation\nand doctrinal disputes also existed between the Buddhist monastic\ncommunity and the contemporaneous Sanskrit Grammarians, Jains, and\nBrahmanical schools with their evolving scholastic and analytical\nmovements, which must also have contributed to the Abdhidharma\ndiscursive hermeneutics and argumentative style. The dialectic format\nand the display of awareness of differences in doctrinal\ninterpretation are the hallmarks of the Kath\u0101vatthu and\nthe Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya. Later on, post-canonical\nAbhidharma texts became complex philosophical treatises employing\nsophisticated methods of argumentation and independent investigations\nthat resulted in doctrinal conclusions quite far removed from their\ncanonical antecedents. \nAbhidharma literature, then, arose from two approaches to discussing\nthe Dharma within the early Buddhist community: the first intended to\nsummarize and analyze the significant points of the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings, the second to elaborate on and interpret the doctrines by\nmeans of monastic disputations (Bronkhorst 2016, 29\u201346; Cousins 1983,\n10; Dessein 2016, 4\u20137; Gethin 1992b, 165; Gethin 2022, 227\u2013242)."},"3":{"chunk_id":"0698b8464ddf1281e851d46ef5ef2f79","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["2.

(Peirce did propose an at least fairly\nprecise statement; but, as explained in the supplement to this entry,\nit does not capture what most nowadays understand by abduction.) Its\ncore idea is often said to be that explanatory considerations have\nconfirmation-theoretic import, or that explanatory success is a (not\nnecessarily unfailing) mark of truth. Clearly, however, these\nformulations are slogans at best, and it takes little effort to see\nthat they can be cashed out in a great variety of prima facie\nplausible ways. Here we will consider a number of such possible\nexplications, starting with what one might term the \u201ctextbook\nversion of abduction,\u201d which, as will be seen, is manifestly\ndefective, and then going on to consider various possible refinements\nof it. What those versions have in\ncommon\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014is that they are all inference\nrules, requiring premises encompassing explanatory considerations and\nyielding a conclusion that makes some statement about the truth of a\nhypothesis. The differences concern the premises that are required, or\nwhat exactly we are allowed to infer from them (or both). \nIn textbooks on epistemology or the philosophy of science, one often\nencounters something like the following as a formulation of\nabduction: \nAn observation that is frequently made about this rule, and that\npoints to a potential problem for it, is that it presupposes the\nnotions of candidate explanation and best explanation, neither of\nwhich has a straightforward interpretation. While some still hope that\nthe former can be spelled out in purely logical, or at least purely\nformal, terms, it is often said that the latter must appeal to the\nso-called theoretical virtues, like simplicity, generality, and\ncoherence with well-established theories; the best explanation would\nthen be the hypothesis which, on balance, does best with respect to\nthese virtues. (See, for instance, Thagard 1978 and McMullin 1996.)\nThe problem is that none of the said virtues is presently particularly\nwell understood. (Giere, in Callebaut (ed.) 1993 (232), even makes the\nradical claim that the theoretical virtues lack real content and play\nno more than a rhetorical role in science. In view of recent formal\nwork both on simplicity and on coherence\u2014for instance, Forster\nand Sober 1994, Li and Vitanyi 1997, and Sober 2015, on simplicity and\nBovens and Hartmann 2003 and Olsson 2005, on coherence\u2014the first\npart of this claim has become hard to maintain; also, Schupbach and\nSprenger (2011) present an account of explanatory goodness directly in\nprobabilistic terms. Psychological evidence casts doubt on the second\npart of the claim; see, for instance, Lombrozo 2007, on the role of\nsimplicity in people\u2019s assessments of explanatory goodness and\nKoslowski et al. 2008, on the role of coherence with\nbackground knowledge in those assessments.) \nFurthermore, many of those who think ABD1 is headed along the right\nlines believe that it is too strong. Some think that abduction\nwarrants an inference only to the probable truth of the best\nexplanation, others that it warrants an inference only to the\napproximate truth of the best explanation, and still others\nthat it warrants an inference only to the probable\napproximate truth. \nThe real problem with ABD1 runs deeper than this, however. Because\nabduction is ampliative\u2014as explained earlier\u2014it will not\nbe a sound rule of inference in the strict logical sense, however\nabduction is explicated exactly. It can still be reliable in\nthat it mostly leads to a true conclusion whenever the premises are\ntrue. An obvious necessary condition for ABD1 to be reliable in this\nsense is that, mostly, when it is true that H best\nexplains E, and E is true, then H is true as well\n(or H is approximately true, or probably true, or probably\napproximately true). But this would not be enough for ABD1 to\nbe reliable. For ABD1 takes as its premise only that some hypothesis\nis the best explanation of the evidence as compared to other\nhypotheses in a given set. Thus, if the rule is to be\nreliable, it must hold that, at least typically, the best explanation\nrelative to the set of hypotheses that we consider would also come out\nas being best in comparison with any other hypotheses that we might\nhave conceived (but for lack of time or ingenuity, or for some other\nreason, did not conceive). In other words, it must hold that at least\ntypically the absolutely best explanation of the evidence is\nto be found among the candidate explanations we have come up with, for\nelse ABD1 may well lead us to believe \u201cthe best of a bad\nlot\u201d (van Fraassen 1989, 143). \nHow reasonable is it to suppose that this extra requirement is usually\nfulfilled? Not at all, presumably. To believe otherwise, we must\nassume some sort of privilege on our part to the effect that when we\nconsider possible explanations of the data, we are somehow predisposed\nto hit, inter alia, upon the absolutely best explanation of those\ndata. After all, hardly ever will we have considered, or will it even\nbe possible to consider, all potential explanations. As van\nFraassen (1989, 144) points out, it is a priori rather\nimplausible to hold that we are thus privileged. \nIn response to this, one might argue that the challenge to show that\nthe best explanation is always or mostly among the hypotheses\nconsidered can be met without having to assume some form of privilege\n(see Schupbach 2014 for a different response, and see Dells\u00e9n\n2017 for discussion). For given the hypotheses we have managed to come\nup with, we can always generate a set of hypotheses which jointly\nexhaust logical space. Suppose\nH1,\u2026,Hn are the\ncandidate explanations we have so far been able to conceive. Then\nsimply define Hn+1 := \u00acH1\n\u2227 \u2026 \u2227 \u00acHn and add this new\nhypothesis as a further candidate explanation to the ones we already\nhave. Obviously, the set\n{H1,\u2026,Hn+1} is exhaustive,\nin that one of its elements must be true. Following this in itself\nsimple procedure would seem enough to make sure that we never miss out\non the absolutely best explanation. (See Lipton 1993, for a proposal\nalong these lines.) \nAlas, there is a catch. For even though there may be many hypotheses\nHj that imply Hn+1 and, had\nthey been formulated, would have been evaluated as being a better\nexplanation for the data than the best explanation among the candidate\nexplanations we started out with, Hn+1 itself will\nin general be hardly informative; in fact, in general it will not even\nbe clear what its empirical consequences are. Suppose, for instance,\nwe have as competing explanations Special Relativity Theory and\nLorentz\u2019s version of the \u00e6ther theory. Then, following the\nabove proposal, we may add to our candidate explanations that neither\nof these two theories is true. But surely this further hypothesis will\nbe ranked quite low qua explanation\u2014if it will be\nranked at all, which seems doubtful, given that it is wholly unclear\nwhat its empirical consequences are. This is not to say that the\nsuggested procedure may never work. The point is that in general it\nwill give little assurance that the best explanation is among the\ncandidate explanations we consider. \nA more promising response to the above \u201cargument of the bad\nlot\u201d begins with the observation that the argument capitalizes\non a peculiar asymmetry or incongruence in ABD1. The rule gives\nlicense to an absolute conclusion\u2014that a given hypothesis is\ntrue\u2014on the basis of a comparative premise, namely, that that\nparticular hypothesis is the best explanation of the evidence relative\nto the other hypotheses available (see Kuipers 2000, 171). This\nincongruence is not avoided by replacing \u201ctruth\u201d with\n\u201cprobable truth\u201d or \u201capproximate truth.\u201d In\norder to avoid it, one has two general options. \nThe first option is to modify the rule so as to have it require an\nabsolute premise. For instance, following Alan Musgrave (1988) or\nPeter Lipton (1993), one may require the hypothesis whose truth is\ninferred to be not only the best of the available potential\nexplanations, but also to be satisfactory (Musgrave) or\ngood enough (Lipton), yielding the following variant of\nABD1: \nNeedless to say, ABD2 needs supplementing by a criterion for the\nsatisfactoriness of explanations, or their being good enough, which,\nhowever, we are still lacking. \nSecondly, one can formulate a symmetric or congruous version of\nabduction by having it sanction, given a comparative premise, only a\ncomparative conclusion; this option, too, can in turn be realized in\nmore than one way. Here is one way to do it, which has been proposed\nand defended in the work of Theo Kuipers (e.g., Kuipers 1984, 1992,\n2000). \nClearly, ABD3 requires an account of closeness to the truth, but many\nsuch accounts are on offer today (see, e.g., Niiniluoto 1998). \nOne noteworthy feature of the congruous versions of abduction\nconsidered here is that they do not rely on the assumption of an\nimplausible privilege on the reasoner\u2019s part that, we saw, ABD1\nimplicitly relies on. Another is that if one can be certain that,\nhowever many candidate explanations for the data one may have missed,\nnone equals the best of those one has thought of, then the\ncongruous versions license exactly the same inference as ABD1 does\n(supposing that one would not be certain that no potential explanation\nis as good as the best explanation one has thought of if the latter is\nnot even satisfactory or sufficiently good). \nAs mentioned, there is widespread agreement that people frequently\nrely on abductive reasoning. Which of the above rules exactly\nis it that people rely on? Or might it be still some further rule that\nthey rely on? Or might they in some contexts rely on one version, and\nin others on another (Douven 2017, forthcoming)? Philosophical\nargumentation is unable to answer these questions. In recent years,\nexperimental psychologists have started paying attention to the role\nhumans give to explanatory considerations in reasoning. For instance,\nTania Lombrozo and Nicholas Gwynne (2014) report experiments showing\nthat how a property of a given class of things is explained\nto us\u2014whether mechanistically, by reference to parts and\nprocesses, or functionally, by reference to functions and\npurposes\u2014matters to how likely we are to generalise that\nproperty to other classes of things (see also Sloman 1994 and Williams\nand Lombrozo 2010). And Igor Douven and Jonah Schupbach (2015a),\n(2015b) present experimental evidence to the effect that\npeople\u2019s probability updates tend to be influenced by\nexplanatory considerations in ways that makes them deviate from\nstrictly Bayesian updates (see below). Douven (2016b) shows that, in\nthe aforementioned experiments, participants who gave more weight to\nexplanatory considerations tended to be more accurate, as determined\nin terms of a standard scoring rule. (See Lombrozo 2012 and 2016 for\nuseful overviews of recent experimental work relevant to explanation\nand inference.) Douven and Patricia Mirabile (2018) found some\nevidence indicating that people rely on something like ABD2, at least\nin some contexts, but for the most part, empirical work on the\nabove-mentioned questions is lacking. \nWith respect to the normative question of which of the previously\nstated rules we ought to rely on (if we ought to rely on any\nform of abduction), where philosophical argumentation should be able\nto help, the situation is hardly any better. In view of the argument\nof the bad lot, ABD1 does not look very good. Other arguments against\nabduction are claimed to be independent of the exact explication of\nthe rule; below, these arguments will be found wanting. On the other\nhand, arguments that have been given in favor of abduction\u2014some\nof which will also be discussed below\u2014do not discern between\nspecific versions. So, supposing people do indeed commonly rely on\nabduction, it must be considered an open question as to which\nversion(s) of abduction they rely on. Equally, supposing it is\nrational for people to rely on abduction, it must be considered an\nopen question as to which version, or perhaps versions, of abduction\nthey ought to, or are at least permitted to, rely on."},"1":{"chunk_id":"a42a267c744818e230cbc1d7deaf3880","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["2.

All these modes of analysis provide\ndescriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and\nmental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and\nconditions. A striking difference between the S\u016btr\u0101nta and\nthe Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time\nscale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment\nto moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by\nwhich the s\u016btras portray sequential processes as\napplying to discrete, momentary events (Cousins 1983, 7; Ronkin 2005,\n66\u201378). \nThese events are referred to as dharmas (Pali,\ndhammas), differently from the singular\ndharma\/dhamma that signifies the Buddha\u2019s teaching(s).\nThe \u0100gamas\/Nik\u0101yas use the form dharmas to convey a\npluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory\nphenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six\nsense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind\n[manas]). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw\nsubtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the\ndifferences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within\nthis context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific\nmental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt.,\nmanovij\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a, Pali,\nmanovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a) that is considered the\ncentral cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception.\nMental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that\ndiscerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and\nthat emerges when the requisite conditions come together.\nDharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts,\nor memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness,\ndharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid\nconsciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in\nsequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with\nthe five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory,\netc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray\ndharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse\ncapacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a\nparticular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set\nor mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and\nconceptualizing\n it.[6] \nUltimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential\nevents are understood as arising from the interaction of\ndharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here,\ndharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena,\nand are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or\ndynamic properties rather than enduring\n substances.[7]\n The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive\naccount of every possible type of experience\u2014every type of\noccurrence that may possibly present itself in one\u2019s\nconsciousness\u2014in terms of its constituent dharmas. This\nenterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception\ninto their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their\nrelations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming\nboth the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and\ntheir synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold\nrelationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the\n\u201cdharma theory.\u201d"},"3":{"chunk_id":"0c46d4d2ec8cb12f6cd0b39e1b70e2bc","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["2. Two fundamental distinctions","2.1 General and specific ability"],"chunk_type":"subsection","philosophers":["Whittle"],"concepts":["Sections 3\u20135","Maier","Major League","Vihvelin"],"content":"\nThe previous section was primarily concerned with distinguishing\nabilities from other powers. But there is also a distinction to be\nmade within the class of abilities itself. This is the distinction\nbetween general and specific abilities\n(Honor\u00e9 1964, Mele 2002). \nThe distinction between general and specific abilities may be brought\nout by way of example. Consider a well-trained tennis player equipped\nwith ball and racquet, standing at the service line. There is, as it\nwere, nothing standing between her and a serve: every prerequisite for\nher serving has been met. Such an agent is in a position to\nserve, or has serving as an option. Let us say that such an\nagent has the specific ability to serve. \nIn contrast, consider an otherwise similar tennis player who lacks a\nracquet and ball, and is miles away from a tennis court. There is\nclearly a good sense in which such an agent has the ability to hit a\nserve: she has been trained to do so, and has done so many times in\nthe past. Yet such an agent lacks the specific ability to\nserve, as that term was just defined. Let us say that such an agent\nhas the general ability to serve. \nThe concern of this article will be general abilities in this sense,\nand unqualified references to \u2018ability\u2019 should be read in\nthat way. But specific abilities will also be at issue. This is for at\nleast two reasons. \nThe first is one of coverage: many of the proposals that are relevant\nto the understanding of ability, especially the classical\n\u2018conditional analysis\u2019 (discussed in Section 3.1 below),\nare naturally read as proposals about specific ability in the present\nsense, and a suitably broad conception of ability lets us keep these\nproposals within our domain of discussion. \nThe second reason is more properly philosophical. If we accept the\ndistinction between general and specific abilities, then we want for\nour account of ability to accommodate both of them, and ultimately to\nexplain how they are related to each other. For this distinction is\nnot plausibly diagnosed as mere ambiguity; it rather marks off\nsomething like two modes of a single kind of power. There are at least\ntwo kinds of proposals one may make here. One, arguably implicit in\nmany of the \u2018new dispositionalist\u2019 approaches to ability,\nis that general ability is in some sense prior to specific ability: to\nhave a specific ability is simply to have a general ability and to\nmeet some further constraint, such as having an opportunity. Another\nproposal (suggested in Maier 2015) is that specific ability is in some\nsense prior to general ability: to have a general ability is simply to\nhave a specific ability under a certain range of circumstances. \nThe idea that there is some sort of bipartite distinction to be made\nbetween abilities has been a prominent theme in contemporary work on\nability. It has been endorsed and developed, in different contexts, by\nGlick (2012), Vihvelin (2013), and Whittle (2010). It is an open\nquestion whether the bipartite distinctions in ability introduced by\nthese authors are the same as one another, or the same as the one\nintroduced here. It could be that there are several bipartite\ndistinctions to be made in this area, or that we simply have one\ndistinction under several names."},"4":{"chunk_id":"b2f14db0c7928ae93fda2e2f3ba1ee27","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["2.

Abhidharma texts of different schools proposed different\ndharma taxonomies, enumerating a more or less finite number\nof dharma categories. It is important to remember, though,\nthat the term dharma signifies both any category that\nrepresents a type of occurrence as well as any of its particular\ntokens or instances. The Therav\u0101da introduced a system of\neighty-two dhamma categories, meaning that there are\neighty-two possible types of occurrence in the experiential world, not\neighty-two occurrences. These are organized into a fourfold\ncategorization. The first three categories include the bare phenomenon\nof consciousness (citta) that encompasses a single\ndhamma type and of which the essential characteristic is the\ncognizing of an object; associated mentality (cetasika) that\nencompasses fifty-two dhammas; and materiality or physical\nphenomena (r\u016bpa) that include twenty-eight\ndhammas that make up all physical occurrences\n(Abhidh-av 1). All the eighty-one dhamma types in\nthese three broad categories are conditioned\n(sa\u1e45khata). Conditioned dhammas arise and\ncease subject to numerous causes and conditions and constitute\nsentient experience in all realms of the round of rebirth\n (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra).[8]\n The eighty-second dhamma that comprises the fourth category\nis unconditioned (asa\u1e45khata): it neither arises nor\nceases through causal interaction. The single occurrence in this\nfourth category is nirvana (Pali, nibb\u0101na). \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da adopted a system of seventy-five basic\ntypes of dharmas organized into a fivefold categorization.\nThe first four categories comprise all conditioned\n(sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta) dharmas and include, again,\nconsciousness (citta, one single dharma); associated\nmentality (caitta, encompasses forty-six dharmas);\nand physical phenomena (r\u016bpa, eleven dharmas);\nbut also factors dissociated from thought\n(cittaviprayuktasa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, fourteen\ndharmas). The last category is mentioned neither in the\ns\u016btras nor in the Therav\u0101da lists, but is found\npredominantly in northern Indian Abhidharma texts of all periods. The\nspecific dharmas included within it vary, but they are all\nunderstood as explaining a range of experiential events, being\nthemselves dissociated from both material form and thought. The fifth\ncategory in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da taxonomy, that of the\nunconditioned (asa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta), comprises three\ndharmas, namely, space and two states of cessation\n(nirodha), the latter being a term that connotes the\nculmination of the Buddhist path (Cox 1995; 2004A, 553\u2013554). \nThe Abhidharma analyzes in great detail each of these categories, thus\ncreating relational schemata whereby each acknowledged experience,\nphenomenon, or occurrence can be determined and identified by\nparticular definition and function. Especially important is the\nanalysis of consciousness or citta, on which much of\nAbhidharma doctrinal thought is built. Consider the Therav\u0101da\nanalysis of consciousness, whose basic principles are shared with the\nother Abhidharma systems. \nThe epitome of the operation of consciousness is citta as\nexperienced in the process of sensory perception that, in Abhidharma\n(as in Buddhism in general), is deemed the paradigm of sentient\nexperience. Citta can never be experienced as bare\nconsciousness in its own origination moment, for consciousness is\nalways intentional, directed to a particular object that is cognized\nby means of certain mental factors. Citta, therefore, always\noccurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental\nfactors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease\ntogether with it, having the same object (either sensuous or mental)\nand grounded in the same sense faculty. Any given consciousness\nmoment\u2014also signified by the very term citta\u2014is\nthus a unique assemblage of citta and its associated mental\nfactors such as feeling, conceptualization, volition, or attention, to\nname several of those required in any thought process. Each assemblage\nis conscious of just one object, arises for a brief instant and then\nfalls away, followed by another citta combination that picks\nup a different object by means of its particular associated mental\nfactors. \nThe classic Abhidhamma scheme as gleaned from the first book of the\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka, the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, and as organized by the\ncommentarial tradition describes eighty-nine basic types of\nconsciousness moments, i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncetasika (Dhs Book I; Vism XIV\n81\u2013110; Abhidh-av 1\u201315; Abhidh-s\n1\u20135). It classifies these basic citta types most\nbroadly according to their locus of occurrence, beginning with the\nsense-sphere (k\u0101m\u0101vacara) that includes forty-five\ncitta types, most prominently those that concern the\nmechanics of perception of sensuous objects; next come eighteen\nform-sphere (r\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that\nconcern the mind that has attained meditative absorption\n(jh\u0101na); followed by eight formless-sphere\n(ar\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that constitute the\nmind that has reached further meditative attainments known as formless\nstates; finally, there are eighteen world-transcending\n(lokuttara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind at the\nmoment of awakening itself: these have nirvana as their object. Within\nthese four broad categories many other classifications operate. For\ninstance, some dhammas are wholesome, others unwholesome;\nsome are resultant, others are not; some are motivated, others are\nwithout motivations. These attribute matrices, writes Cox (2004A,\n552), form \u201can abstract web of all possible conditions and\ncharacteristics exhibited by actually occurring dharmas. The\nindividual character of any particular dharma can then be\nspecified in accordance with every taxonomic possibility, resulting in\na complete assessment of that dharma\u2019s range of\npossible occurrences.\u201d \nVarious scholars have argued that this system reflects a dynamic\nconception of dharmas: that Abhidharma understands\ndharmas as properties, activities, or patterns of\ninterconnection that construct one\u2019s world, not as static\nsubstances (e.g., Cox 2004A, 549ff; Gethin 1992A, 149\u2013150;\nKarunadasa 2010, Ch. 4; Nyanaponika 1998, Ch. 2 & 4; Ronkin 2005,\nCh. 4; Waldron 2002, 2\u201316). The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are\n\u201cexplicitly open\u201d and reflect \u201ca certain reluctance\nand hesitancy to say categorically that such and such is the\ndefinitive list of dharmas\u201d (Gethin 2017, 252), leaving room for\ncontinued debates about what is and is not a dharma. For the\nAbhidharma, as for Buddhism in general, the limits of one\u2019s\nworld are set by the limits of one\u2019s lived experience, and the\ncausal foundation for lived experience is the operation of one\u2019s\ncognitive apparatus. According to the Buddhist path, the nature of\nlived experience as based on one\u2019s cognitive apparatus is to be\ncontemplated by investigating the very nature of one\u2019s mind\nthrough the practice of meditation. From this perspective, Abhidharma\nrepresents the theoretical counterpart to the practice of meditation.\nWithin this context of Buddhist practice, dharmas are\ndistinct (but interrelated) functions, energies, or causally\nsignificant aspects\u2014in this sense\n\u201ccomponents\u201d\u2014of consciousness moments. \nThe categorial analysis of dharmas is therefore a meditative\npractice of discernment of dharmas: it is not intended as a\nclosed inventory of all existing dharmas \u201cout\nthere\u201d in their totality, but rather \u201chas a dual\nsoteriological purpose involving two simultaneous processes\u201d\n(Cox 2004A, 551). First, as \u201cevaluative\u201d analysis, the\ndharma typology maps out the constituents and workings of the\nmind and accounts for what makes up ordinary wholesome consciousness\nas opposed to the awakened mind. For instance, consciousness types\nthat arise in a mind that has attained meditative absorption become\nincreasingly refined and may never involve certain tendencies or\ndefilements that might potentially occur in ordinary (even wholesome)\nconsciousness. To watch dharmas as dharmas, writes\nGethin (2004, 536), \u201cinvolves watching how they arise and\ndisappear, how the particular qualities that one wants to abandon can\nbe abandoned, and how the particular qualities that one wants to\ndevelop can be developed. Watching dhammas in this way one\nbegins to understand [\u2026] certain truths\n(sacca)\u2014four to be exact\u2014about these\ndhammas: their relation to suffering, its arising, its\nceasing and the way to its ceasing. And in seeing these four truths\none realizes the ultimate truth\u2014dhamma\u2014about the\n world.\u201d[9] \nThe second, \u201cdescriptive\u201d soteriological process involved\nin the categorization of dharmas reveals the fluid nature of\nsentient experience and validates the fundamental Buddhist teaching of\nnot-self (Skt., an\u0101tman, Pali, anatta). The\nincreasingly detailed enumerations of dharmas demonstrate\nthat no essence or independent self could be found in any phenomenon\nor its constituents, since all aspects of experience are impermanent,\narising and passing away subject to numerous causes and conditions.\nEven the handful dharmas that are categorized as\nunconditioned (that is, having no cause and no effect) are shown to be\nnot-self. The practice of the discrimination of dharmas thus\nundermines the apparently solid world we emotionally and\nintellectually grasp at that is replete with objects of desire and\nattachment. \u201cTry to grasp the world of the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, or the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na,\u201d Gethin notes (1992B, 165),\n\u201cand it runs through one\u2019s fingers.\u201d \nNevertheless, the very notion of the plurality of dharmas as\nthe building blocks or the final units of analysis of sentient\nexperience signifies a considerable shift in the Buddhist\nunderstanding of dharma. Abhidharma thought was gradually\ndrawn into espousing a naturalistic explanation of dharmas as\nthe fundamental constituents of the phenomenal world, increasingly\nassociating dharmas as primary existents. The category of the\nunconditioned within the dharma taxonomy also asserted the\npossibility of enduring or permanent dharmas, in contrast to\nall other dharmas that arise and cease through causal\ninteraction. The Abhidharma exegesis, then, occasioned among Buddhist\ncircles doctrinal controversies that could be termed ontological\naround such issues as what the nature of a dharma is; what,\nin the internal constitution of a dharma, makes it the very\nparticular it is; the manner of existence of dharmas; the\ndynamics of their causal interaction; and the nature of the reality\nthey constitute. The distinctive principles and their ensuing\nontological interpretations constructed by the Buddhist schools were\nlargely shaped by a radical construal of impermanence as\nmomentariness."},"3":{"chunk_id":"d15693a3f67c91b0030f1c7992c819a3","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["2.

Thus we are often asked to\ndistinguish senses of \u2018ability\u2019, or to think\nabout what \u2018can\u2019 means. This subtle shift between\ndiscussing ability and discussing the ascription of ability is often\nharmless. Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind the distinction\nbetween these questions, and to mark this distinction explicitly at\nthe outset. \nOn the one hand, there are questions about ability itself. The central\nquestion here to give an account of what an ability is, in the sense\nforegrounded at the outset. Subsidiary questions here include, for\nexample, whether abilities may exist when they are unexercised,\nwhether abilities are intrinsic or extrinsic features of their\nbearers, and whether agents have abilities in deterministic worlds.\nThese are, broadly speaking, questions about the metaphysics of\nability. \nOn the other hand, there are questions about ability-ascriptions.\nAbilities are characteristically ascribed (in English) with sentences\ninvolving the modal auxiliaries \u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is able\nto.\u2019 Accordingly, the central question here is to give a\nsemantics for sentences involving those expressions. Subsidiary tasks\ninclude resolving certain open problems in the semantics of these\nexpressions, such as the \u2018actuality entailment\u2019 observed\nin (Bhatt 1999), and integrating a semantics for agentive modals with\na semantics for modal expressions more generally. These are, broadly\nspeaking, questions about the semantics of agentive modality. \nOn certain conceptions of the philosophical enterprise, the project of\ngiving a theory of ability and that of giving a semantics for\nability-ascriptions are closely connected, and even collapse into each\nother. Nonetheless, there is at least a methodological distinction to\nbe marked here. Having marked that distinction, this discussion will\nprimarily be concerned with the first of these projects, the project\nof giving a theory of ability. Nonetheless, the project of giving a\nsemantics for ability-ascriptions will also frequently be relevant. As\nwith the distinction between general and specific abilities, this is\nfor two reasons, one of coverage and one more properly\nphilosophical. \nThe first reason, that of coverage, is the following. Many of the most\nprominent theories of ability defended in the philosophical literature\nhave in fact been, in the first place, theories of\nability-ascriptions. Indeed, the central thought in much work on\nability in the analytic tradition has been a kind of semantic\ndeflationism, on which we may give a semantics for ability-ascriptions\nthat does not quantify over abilities themselves. This is arguably the\nmain theme of the hypothetical theories to be considered in Section 3,\nand the modal theories to be considered in Section 4. Given this\ntendency in thinking about ability, an overview of philosophical work\non ability that neglected the role of ability-ascriptions would be\nseriously incomplete. \nThere is also the second, more philosophical, reason. Any account of\nabilities owes us, among other things, an account of\nability-ascriptions. This is perhaps true of philosophical topics\ngenerally, but it is true of ability in particular. Even philosophers\nwho are explicit in their \u2018refusal to take language as a\nstarting point in the analysis of thought and modality\u2019 (Lewis\n1986, xi) are prone to make explicit appeal to language when the topic\nturns to ability, as occurs in (Lewis 1976) or (Taylor 1960). This is\nfor any number of reasons, but perhaps especially because it is\ndifficult to even identify the topic under consideration without using\nor mentioning certain phrases, notably \u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is\nable to.\u2019 \nHappily, the topic of ability-ascriptions is one on which linguists\nand philosophers have made significant progress. While there has long\nbeen considerable philosophical interest expressions such as\n\u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is able to,\u2019\u00a0there is nothing\nrecognizable as a rigorous semantic theory of such terms prior to the\nfoundational work of Angelika Kratzer, recently revised and collected\nin (Kratzer 2012). Kratzer\u2019s work has been central to natural\nlanguage semantics, and its significance for philosophical work is\nstill being appreciated. The question of whether it is correct as an\naccount of the semantics of agentive modality is an open one:\nimportant challenges include (Hackl 1998) and, more recently,\n(Mandelkern, Schultheis, and Boylan, 2017), (Schwarz 2020), and\n(Willer forthcoming). The Kratzer semantics, and a view of ability on\nwhich that semantics plays a foundational role, will be considered in\nsome detail in Section 4. The more methodological point being made\nhere is that any adequate account of ability ought to provide an\naccount of ability-ascriptions, and as such may want to reckon with\nthis ongoing debate in the semantics of modal expressions."},"4":{"chunk_id":"09ea08e5e97fd49719e33879a6600157","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["2.

For example, the term\n\u2018animal\u2019 has the sense living substance, which is\ninherently general, and it refers to each individual animal since each\nis a living substance\u2014as Abelard puts it, since each has the\nstatus of being a living substance.

Abner had an original view on the\nTrinity. In his opinion, one can prove philosophically the reality of\nthe\n Trinity.[14]\n He claimed that only the division of the divine source of the world\ncan explain the diversity of the world. The infinite force of God (the\nfather) would burn the finite matter of the world if it were not for\nsome \u201ctransformer\u201d that adapted the divine force to the\nfinitude of matter (the son). Abner distinguished between two parts of\nthe son. The superior son is part of the transcendent divinity. The\ninferior son is the divine essence in all the different parts of the\nworld. The transformer of the divine force and essence is the superior\nson. \nRegarding the theory of the divine attributes, Abner also had an\noriginal opinion. He distinguished between the attributes that are the\nessence of God and the attributes that are essential to God. The\nattributes of the essence of God divide themselves only within the\npersonas of the Trinity. The rest of the attributes are only essential\nto God (and could be attributed to any one of the personas). This\ndivision of the divine attributes influenced Rabbi Hasdai Crescas,who\nlater influenced Spinoza. \nAbner\u2019s opinion on Incarnation was also very original. According to\nAbner, the essence of God is in the entire world. The world is\ncomposed only of corrupted matter and of divine essence in different\ndegrees of purity. Even the most corrupted matter has inside itself\nsome divine essence. The divine essence gives the corporeal form to\nmatter and produces in it its dimensions. The uniqueness of a human\nbeing is the capacity to purify one\u2019s matter, thereby reaching a\nhigher degree of divine essence. According to Abner, what made Jesus\nunique was that he was born of the highest matter, enabling him to\nunite with the highest degree of divine essence that a human can\nattain. Abner thought that the superior son does not incarnate in this\nworld. Jesus was only the highest degree of the inferior son that is\npresent in the essences of the entire world. \nThe opinion of Abner on Incarnation is closely related to his view of\nthe doctrine of Original Sin. In Abner\u2019s opinion, the reason for the\noriginal sin was Adam\u2019s lack of comprehension. Adam thought that his\nintellect, which is an incarnation of divinity in people, was God, and\nhe therefore wrongly concluded that he was God. In order to fix Adam\u2019s\nerror, humanity needed the Torah of Moses, which emphasized the unity\nof God in an exaggerated form and therefore explained (somewhat\ninaccurately) that God does not incarnate in the World at all. Only\nafter this critical step, humanity was able to understand that, though\nthere is divinity in humans, this divinity is not an independent God,\nbut rather a part of the divine essence in the whole world. The Law of\nMoses that came to purify the world from idolatry has some problems.\nIt does not enable the full emancipation of humanity from sin and\nerror. Abner claimed that the negation of the incarnation of God in\nthe world leads to negating the possibility of life after death. The\npossibility of life after death comes from understanding the\nincarnation of divinity in all humans. Negating life after death\ncauses immorality. The Torah has to put up with all these inaccuracies\nin order to achieve its main goal, which is taking humanity out of the\nsin of idolatry (by believing that God is one). The outcome, though\nbetter than its predecessor, is ultimately a lost situation which\nhumanity cannot overcome on its own. For that reason, God sent Jesus\n(who was born with a higher degree of matter and divine essence). Due\nto the divinity within Jesus, his miracles and his resurrection,\npeople are able to understand that within everything in the world\nthere is some divine essence that is part of the inferior son, and\nthat the origin of all the divinity in the world is the superior son.\nThis understanding enables salvation from the original sin and\nrepresents a true understanding of the relation between God and the\nworld. The role of the sacramentental Mass is to remind us of the\ndivine aspect of Jesus\u2019 essence, as well as of all the miracles that\nJesus performed and to continue their influence in our present\ntime. \nWe see that this opinion regarding the Trinity and Incarnation\ncontradict the official dogma of the Catholic Church at the time of\nAbner. In his opinion, the incarnation of divinity in Jesus did not\nbypass the regular process of the emanation of the divine essence in\nthe world. Rather, the manifestation of Jesus represented the pinnacle\nof incarnation of divinity, which, though indeed present in the entire\nworld, yet in Jesus occurred in the purest form possible. This opinion\nof Abner, similar to his other philosophical views, was a part of the\nradical Neo-Platonic interpretation of Christianity. The difference\nbetween him and the other Neo-Platonic Christian philosophers, like\nMaster Eckard, is the different sources from which they were\ninfluenced. Abner did not utilize the traditional Neo-Platonic\nChristian sources, like Dionysius the Areopagite. We do not see in any\npart of his work that he was aware of the existence of these sources.\nOn the other hand, Abner did utilize some Arabic and Jewish sources.\nThe origin of his uncommon position on Christianity is found in his\nopposition to the common Aristotelian-Maimonidean-Averroist trend of\nJewish philosophy. Abner, similar to Spinoza after him, thought that\nthe explanations of these thinkers on the question of the creation of\nthe world by a perfect God were not sufficient and ultimately\ninaccurate. In place of these responses, Abner proposed his radical\ninterpretation of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, an\ninterpretation that was uninfluenced by the theological Christian\ntradition.

In this section, we\nwill survey that form of analysis, the problems for it, and\nalternatives to it that are supposed to overcome those problems. \nThe conditional analysis of ability has at least two aspects. First,\nS has an ability to A just in case a certain\nconditional is true of her. Second, that conditional has the following\nform: S would A if S were to have a certain\nvolition. The precise form such an analysis will take will depend on,\nfirst, how we interpret this conditional and, second, which volition\nfigures in the antecedent. \nIt has been standard in the literature, when this first question has\nbeen raised, to understand the conditional as a subjunctive\nconditional (Ginet 1980), and we will assume in what follows that this\nis the best form of the conditional analysis. There has been some\ndisagreement about whether it is a might or a would\nconditional that is relevant (for an account of this distinction, see\nLewis 1973, 21\u201324), as well as about which volition is relevant.\nIn the following, we will take the relevant conditional to be a\nwould conditional, and the relevant volition to be\ntrying, though nothing will hang on these selections, and the\npoints to be raised would apply also to other forms of conditional\nanalysis, mutatis mutandis. \nWe thus arrive at the following form of the conditional analysis: \n(CA)\nS has the ability to A iff S would\nA if S tried to A.\n \nIf (CA) were true, it would constitute a theory of ability in that it\nwould say under exactly what conditions some agent has the ability to\nperform some action without making reference to the idea of ability\nitself. (Note that a variant on (CA) that is sometimes discussed,\naccording to which S has the ability to A iff\nS could A if S tried to\nA, would not meet this standard, since the\n\u2018could\u2019 seems to make a claim about S\u2019s\nabilities. So such a view is not really a conditional\nanalysis. Indeed, it is not even clear that it involves a\ngenuine conditional, for reasons discussed in Austin 1970\n(211\u2013213). \nThe conditional analysis so understood has been subject to a fair\namount of criticism, which will be reviewed in the following section.\nIt bears noting, however, just how apt an account of ability it seems\nat first pass. It satisfies, at least at first approximation, the\nextensional constraints: there are many actions with respect to which\na typical agent satisfies the relevant conditional, and also many\nactions with respect to which she does not, and these roughly\ncorrespond to her abilities. This imposes a demand even on those who\nwish to reject (CA), namely to explain why, if (CA) is simply\nfalse, it so closely approximates to the truth about abilities. \nIts approximate satisfaction of the extensional constraints is also\nplausibly a reason why something like (CA) has found so many\nthoughtful advocates. It is at least strongly suggested, for example,\nby the following remarks from Hume\u2019s Enquiry: \nFor what is meant by liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We\ncannot surely mean that actions have so little connexion with motives,\ninclinations, and circumstances, that one does not follow with a\ncertain degree of uniformity from the other, and that one affords no\ninference by which we can conclude the existence of the other. For\nthese are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we\ncan only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the\ndeterminations of the will; this is, if we choose to remain at rest,\nwe may; if we choose to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical\nliberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a\nprisoner and in chains. (8.1; Hume 1748, 72)\n \nOf course, Hume and many of those who have followed him have been\nattempting to do something rather more than to offer a theory\nof ability. Hume\u2019s intent was to show that disputes over\n\u2018question of liberty and necessity, the most contentious\nquestion of metaphysics\u2019 have been \u2018merely verbal\u2019\n(8.1; Hume 1748, 72). Whatever we may think of this striking claim,\nhowever, there is a dialectical gap between it and the alleged truth\nof (CA). To anticipate a theme that will be central in what follows,\nwe must be careful to distinguish between, on the one hand, the\nadequacy of various views of ability and, on the other, the more\ncontentious metaphysical questions about freedom to which they are\ndoubtlessly related. It is the former that will be our concern in this\nsection."},"4":{"chunk_id":"5cf4d392b6a31f483411eecba6caa170","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["3.

There are two kinds of\ncounterexamples that may be brought against (CA): counterexamples to\nits sufficiency, and to its necessity. Let us take these in turn. \nCounterexamples to the sufficiency of (CA) have been most\nprominent in the literature. Informally, they are suggested by the\nquestion: \u2018but could S try to A?\u2019 There\nare a variety of ways of translating this rhetorical question into a\ncounterexample. We may distinguish two: global\ncounterexamples, according to which (CA) might always get the\nfacts about ability wrong, and local counterexamples,\naccording to which (CA) might sometimes get the facts about\nability wrong. \nBegin with global counterexamples. Let us say that\ndeterminism is true at our world. Familiar arguments purport\nto show that, if this is the case, then no one has the ability to do\nanything, except perhaps for what she actually does (for several\ndevelopments of such an argument, see van Inwagen 1983, 55\u2013105).\nBut if (CA) is true, then agents would have the ability to perform\nvarious actions that they do not actually perform. For it is plausible\nthat the conditionals in terms of which (CA) analyzes ability would\nstill be true in a deterministic world. But then, since it makes false\npredictions about such a world, which for all we know may be our own,\n(CA) is false. \nThe difficulties involved in this sort of counterexample are clear.\nThe proponent of (CA) will reject the arguments for the\nincompatibility of ability and determinism as unsound. Indeed, it is\nprecisely her thought that such arguments are unsound that has\ntypically led her to take ability to be analyzed in terms like those\nof (CA). So global counterexamples, while they may be successful, are\ndialectically ineffective relative to the range of questions\nthat are at issue in the debates over ability. \nIt seems, however, that we can show that (CA) is false even relative\nto premises that are shared between various disputants in the free\nwill debates. This is what is shown by local counterexamples\nto (CA). One such example is given by Keith Lehrer: \nSuppose that I am offered a bowl of candy and in the bowl are small\nround red sugar balls. I do not choose to take one of the red sugar\nballs because I have a pathological aversion to such candy. (Perhaps\nthey remind me of drops of blood and \u2026 ) It is logically\nconsistent to suppose that if I had chosen to take the red sugar ball,\nI would have taken one, but, not so choosing, I am utterly unable to\ntouch one. (Lehrer 1968, 32)\n \nSuch an example shows that (CA) is false without assuming anything\ncontentious in debates over freedom. It turns rather on a simple\npoint: that psychological shortcomings, just as much as external\nimpediments, may undermine abilities. (CA), which does not recognize\nthis point, is therefore subject to counterexamples where such\npsychological shortcomings become relevant. We may, if we like,\ndistinguish \u2018psychological\u2019 from\n\u2018non-psychological\u2019 ability, and claim that (CA) correctly\naccounts for the latter (this sort of strategy is suggested, for\nexample, by Albritton 1985). But our ordinary notion of ability, that\nof which we are attempting to give a theory, seems to involve\nboth psychological and non-psychological requirements. And if\nthat is correct, then Lehrer\u2019s example succeeds as a\ncounterexample to (CA) as a theory of our ordinary notion of\nability. \nCounterexamples to the necessity of (CA) have been less\nfrequently discussed (though see Wolf 1990), but they also raise\nimportant issues about ability. Consider a case where a good golfer\nmisses an easy putt. Given that this golfer tried to make the putt and\nfailed to, it is false that she would have made the putt if she had\ntried to; after all, she did try it and did not make it.\n(This thought is vindicated by standard views of subjunctive\nconditionals; see Bennett 2003, 239). But, as a good golfer, she\npresumably had the ability to make the putt. So this seems to be a\ncase where one can have an ability without satisfying the relevant\nconditional, and hence a counterexample to the necessity of (CA). \nHere the defender of (CA) might avail herself of the distinction\nbetween specific and general abilities. (CA), she might say, is an\naccount of what it is to have a specific ability: that is, to actually\nbe in a position to perform an action. The golfer does lack\nthis ability in this case, as (CA) correctly predicts. It is\nnonetheless true that the golfer has the general ability to\nsink putts like this. But (CA) does not purport to be an analysis of\ngeneral ability, and as such is compatible with the golfer having that\nsort of ability. Again, the plausibility of this response will hang on\nthe viability of the distinction between specific and general\nabilities. \nWe have seen that (CA) faces serious problems, especially as a\nsufficient condition for ability, even once we set to one\nside contentious claims about freedom and determinism. If this is\ncorrect, then (CA) must either be modified or rejected outright. Let\nus first consider the prospects for modification."},"4":{"chunk_id":"45ae988f4cf147ef32d132bfb24313e5","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["3.

There are a number of ways of developing\nthis idea that do not fit into the form of (CA). At least two such\nproposals deserve attention here. \nDonald Davidson takes concerns about the sufficiency of (CA),\nespecially as developed in Chisholm 1964, to tell decisively against\nit. More specifically, he takes the lesson of this problem to be is\nthat: \nThe antecedent of a causal conditional that attempts to analyze\n\u2018can\u2019 or \u2018could\u2019 or \u2018free to\u2019 must\nnot contain, as its dominant verb, a verb of action, or any verb\nwhich makes sense of the question, Can someone do it?\n(Davidson 1980, 68)\n \nDavidson suggests that we may overcome this difficulty at least by\nendorsing: \nA can do x intentionally (under the description\nd) means that if A has desires and beliefs that\nrationalize x (under d), then A does\nx. (Davidson 1980, 68)\n \nDavidson proceeds to consider a number of further problems for this\nproposal and for the causal theory of action generally, but he takes\nit to suffice at least to overcome standard objections to the\nsufficiency of (CA). \nThe trouble is that it is not at all clear it does so. For these\nobjections did not essentially depend on a verb of action figuring in\nthe antecedent of the analyzing conditional. Consider Lehrer\u2019s\ncase again. It seems true that if Lehrer\u2019s imagined agent\nhas desires and beliefs that rationalized that action under the\ndescription \u2018eating a red candy\u2019\u2014namely, adopting\nthe analysis of Davidson 1963, a desire for a red candy and a belief\nthat this action is a way of eating a red candy\u2014she would eat a\nred candy. But the trouble is precisely that, in virtue of her\npsychological disability, she is incapable of having this desire, and\nso cannot perform this action intentionally. For this reason it does\nnot seem that Davidson\u2019s proposal successfully overcomes the\nsufficiency problem, at least not on Lehrer\u2019s way of developing\nthat problem. \nA second and rather different approach to modifying (CA) has been\ntaken in recent work by Christopher Peacocke. Peacocke accepts that\n(CA) is insufficient in light of counterexamples like Lehrer\u2019s.\nBut he argues that we might supplement (CA) in order to\novercome these difficulties. In the terms of the present discussion,\nPeacocke\u2019s proposal is: S has the ability to A\njust in case: (i) (CA) is true of S and (ii) the\npossibility in which S tries to A is a\n\u2018close\u2019 one. The closeness of a possibility as it figures\nin (ii) is to be understood, at first pass, in terms of what we can\nreasonably rely on: a possibility is a distant one just in\ncase we can reasonably rely on it not obtaining; otherwise it is a\nclose one (Peacocke 1999, 310). To modify one of Peacocke\u2019s\nexamples, the possibility of toxic fumes being released into a train\ncar that is safely insulated is a distant one; on the other hand, the\npossibility of toxic fumes being released into a train car where they\njust happen to be blocked by a fortuitous arrangement of luggage is a\nclose one. \nPeacocke\u2019s thought is that this suffices to overcome the\nsufficiency objection: though Lehrer\u2019s agent satisfies (i), she\ndoes not satisfy (ii): given the facts about his psychology, the\npossibility that he tries to A is not a close one. The\ntrouble, however, is that Peacocke\u2019s proposal is subject to\nmodified versions of Lehrer\u2019s counterexample. Consider an agent\nwhose aversion to red candies is not a permanent feature of her\npsychology, but an unpredictable and temporary \u2018mood\u2019.\nConsider the agent at some time when she is in her aversive mood. This\nagent satisfies (i), for the same reason as above, and she also\nsatisfies (ii): given the fragility of her mood, the possibility of\nher trying is a close one in the relevant sense. Yet such an agent\nlacks the ability to eat a red candy, in precisely the same way as she\ndoes in Lehrer\u2019s original example. \nIt is an interesting question how we might develop other\n\u2018supplementation\u2019 strategies for (CA) (such strategies are\nalso suggested by Ginet 1980), though the track record of this method\nof analysis in other domains (for instance, the project of\n\u2018supplementing\u2019 the analysis of knowledge in terms of\njustified true belief, in response to (Gettier 1963)) does not inspire\nconfidence."},"4":{"chunk_id":"7d149098ef7ece61d23b241111569937","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["3.

In order to fix Adam\u2019s\nerror, humanity needed the Torah of Moses, which emphasized the unity\nof God in an exaggerated form and therefore explained (somewhat\ninaccurately) that God does not incarnate in the World at all. Only\nafter this critical step, humanity was able to understand that, though\nthere is divinity in humans, this divinity is not an independent God,\nbut rather a part of the divine essence in the whole world. The Law of\nMoses that came to purify the world from idolatry has some problems.\nIt does not enable the full emancipation of humanity from sin and\nerror. Abner claimed that the negation of the incarnation of God in\nthe world leads to negating the possibility of life after death. The\npossibility of life after death comes from understanding the\nincarnation of divinity in all humans. Negating life after death\ncauses immorality. The Torah has to put up with all these inaccuracies\nin order to achieve its main goal, which is taking humanity out of the\nsin of idolatry (by believing that God is one). The outcome, though\nbetter than its predecessor, is ultimately a lost situation which\nhumanity cannot overcome on its own.

His\nlogical system is flawed in its handling of topical inference, but\nthat should not prevent our recognition of Abelard\u2019s\nachievements. \nAbelard observes that the same propositional content can be expressed\nwith different force in different contexts: the content that\nSocrates is in the house is expressed in an assertion in\n\u2018Socrates is in the house\u2019; in a question in \u2018Is\nSocrates in the house?\u2019; in a wish in \u2018If only Socrates\nwere in the house!\u2019 and so on. Hence Abelard can distinguish in\nparticular the assertive force of a sentence from its propositional\ncontent, a distinction that allows him to point out that the component\nsentences in a conditional statement are not asserted, though they\nhave the same content they do when asserted\u2014\u2018If Socrates\nis in the kitchen, then Socrates is in the house\u2019 does not\nassert that Socrates is in the kitchen or that he is in the house, nor\ndo the antecedent or the consequent, although the same form of words\ncould be used outside the scope of the conditional to make such\nassertions. Likewise, the distinction allows Abelard to define\nnegation, and other propositional connectives, purely\ntruth-functionally in terms of content, so that negation, for\ninstance, is treated as follows: not-p is false\/true if and\nonly if p is true\/false. \nThe key to the theory of argument, for Abelard, is found in\ninferentia, best rendered as \u2018entailment\u2019, since\nAbelard requires the connection between the propositions involved to\nbe both necessary and relevant. That is, the conclusion\u2014more\nexactly, the sense of the final statement\u2014is required by the\nsense of the preceding statement(s), so that it cannot be otherwise.\nAbelard often speaks of the sense of the final statement being\n\u201ccontained\u201d in the sense of the preceding statement(s),\nmuch as we speak of the conclusion being contained in the premisses.\nAn entailment is complete (perfecta) when it holds in virtue\nof the logical form (complexio) of the propositions involved.\nBy this, Abelard tells us, he means that the entailment holds under\nany uniform substitution in its terms, the criterion now associated\nwith Bolzano. The traditional four figures and moods of the\ncategorical syllogism derived from Aristotle, and the doctrine of the\nhypothetical syllogism derived from Boethius, are all instances of\ncomplete entailments, or as we should say, valid inference. \nThere is another way in which conclusions can be necessary and\nrelevant to their premisses, yet not be formally valid (not\nbe a complete entailment). The necessary connection among the\npropositions, and the link among their senses, might be a function of\nnon-formal metaphysical truths holding in all possible worlds. For\ninstance, human beings are a kind of animal, so the consequence\n\u2018If Socrates is a human being, Socrates is an animal\u2019\nholds of necessity and the sense of the antecedent compels that of the\nconsequent, but it is not formally valid under uniform substitution.\nAbelard takes such incomplete entailments to hold according to the\ntheory of the topics (to be forms of so-called topical inference). The\nsample inference above is validated by the topic \u201cfrom the\nspecies\u201d, a set of metaphysical relations one of which is\nexpressible in the rule \u201cWhatever the species is predicated of,\nso too is the genus\u201d which grounds the inferential force of the\nentailment. Against Boethius, Abelard maintained that topical rules\nwere only needed for incomplete entailment, and in particular are not\nrequired to validate the classical moods of the categorical and\nhypothetical syllogism mentioned in the preceding paragraph. \nAbelard spends a great deal of effort to explore the complexities of\nthe theory of topical inference, especially charting the precise\nrelations among conditional sentences, arguments, and what he calls\n\u201cargumentation\u201d (roughly what follows from conceded\npremisses). One of the surprising results of his investigation is that\nhe denies that a correlate of the Deduction Theorem holds, maintaining\nthat a valid argument need not correspond to an acceptable conditional\nsentence, nor conversely, since the requirements on arguments and\nconditionals differ. \nIn the end, it seems that Abelard\u2019s principles of topical\ninference do not work, a fact that became evident with regard to the\ntopic \u201cfrom opposites\u201d: Abelard\u2019s principles lead to\ninconsistent results, a result noted by Alberic of Paris. This led to\na crisis in the theory of inference in the twelfth century, since\nAbelard unsuccessfully tried to evade the difficulty. These debates\nseem to have taken place in the later part of the 1130s, as Abelard\nwas about to become embroiled with Bernard of Clairvaux, and his\nattention was elsewhere."},"2":{"chunk_id":"aed751ccc356ff98c06e92c70a7c43c3","article_title":"Abhidharma","section_path":["2.

It is\nin some sense a truism that someone is able to perform some act just\nin case it is possible for her to perform it. \nTo develop this purported truism, begin with the thought that for\nS to have an ability to A it is necessary, but not\nsufficient, that it be possible that S does A. This\nclaim will be contentious for various more specialized sorts of\npossibility, such as nomic possibility. But if we may help\nourselves to the idea of possibility simpliciter\n(\u2018metaphysical possibility,\u2019\u00a0on at least one reading\nof that phrase), then this claim appears plausible. (We will survey\nsome historical and contemporary challenges to it below in Section\n4.2.) On the other hand it seems implausible that this sort of\npossibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of acts\nthat that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent might\nnonetheless not be able to perform. \nThis suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability is for it to be\npossible to A in some restricted sense of\npossibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to the laws\nof nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative to what\nan agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some\nindependently specifiable set of conditions. \nTo render this hypothesis precisely, we may help ourselves to the\nformal framework of \u2018possible worlds,\u2019 which offers an\nelegant and powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework,\na proposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible\nworld. We can then say an agent is able to A just in case she performs\nthat act at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some\nindependently specifiable set of conditions. \nWe thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability: \n(MA) S has the ability to A iff S\ndoes A at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition\nC.\n \n(MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a\ngeneral family of analyses. Different members of this family will be\ndistinguished by the different candidates they might propose for C, as\nwell as whether they quantify over individual worlds or sets of\nworlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient theoretical\nunity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of abstraction,\nas a single approach to the analysis of ability. \nTwo points about (MA) bear noting. First, \u2018modal\u2019 here is\nbeing used in a relatively strict and narrow way. Sometimes\n\u2018modal\u2019 is used loosely to describe phenomena that are\nconnected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. As\nnoted above, it is a truism that there is some connection between\nability and necessity, and so that ability is in this loose sense\n\u2018modal.\u2019 The proponent of (MA) is concerned with modality\nin a stricter sense: she proposes that ability may be analyzed in\nterms of the precise framework of propositions and possible worlds\njust adumbrated. The opponent of (MA), in turn, grants that ability\nhas something to do with possibility but denies that any such analysis\nsucceeds. \nSecond, while (MA) has been presented as an alternative to (CA), (CA)\nis arguably just one particular version of (MA). For, as noted above,\n(CA) appeals to a subjunctive conditional, and the standard semantics\nfor the subjunctive conditional (developed in slightly different ways\nin Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973) is told in terms of quantification\nover possible worlds. Specifically (on Stalnaker\u2019s version) a\nsubjunctive conditional is true just in case its consequent is true at\nthe world where its antecedent is true that is otherwise maximally\nsimilar to the actual world. In these terms, (CA) is roughly\nequivalent to the following: \n(CAmodal) S has the ability to A\niff S does A at a world at which S tries\nto A that is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world.\n \nThis is patently a version of (MA), with \u2018S tries\nto A and is otherwise maximally similar to the actual\nworld\u2019 serving as condition C. \nIf this is correct, then most discussions of the analysis on ability\nin the twentieth century have focused on a special and somewhat\nidiosyncratic case of a much broader program of analysis, namely the\nprogram of giving a modal analysis of ability. The considerations\nbrought forth in the remainder of this section, in contrast, are\nconcerned with the general case."},"4":{"chunk_id":"b487ec208453c6a4c469e21b37a63ca8","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["4.

After the explication of this opinion and its\nnegation, Abner explains his deterministic opinion. Abner believed\nthat people have free will in a limited sense, but act in a determined\nway in the broader sense. People are free in their relation to\nthemselves, meaning that if a person is separated from the causes that\ninfluence him or her (e.g., education, society\u2019s influences) while\ndebating between two options, one is then really free to choose either\nof the two options. In this specific case a person can then utilize\nhis or her will and choose freely between the two options. However, if\none takes into account all the causes that influence his or her will,\nwe may conclude that these causes limits that person\u2019s will to only\none of the two options. In the opinion of Abner, people are like wax,\nas follows: Wax may be melted and sculpted into many different shapes.\nHowever, the person who sculpts the wax determines its present form as\nonly one of those options. The same is true about people: In\nthemselves, they have the ability to choose between different\npossibilities, but their relation to the outside world determines\ntheir choices. We can see from this example how strong the determinist\nview of Abner was. It is important to note that Abner defines the will\nof people as an accord between the attractive force and the\nimagination, two forces common to humans and animals. \nAbner explains in the same way the meaning of possibility and\naccident. Things are only possible in their relation to themselves. In\nrelation to the entire world and its causality, everything is truly\ndetermined. Accidents are only accidents relative to the seeming\nunlikelihood of their occurrence. However, relative to all the causal\nprocesses of the world, we see that even in the most unusual of\ncircumstances the occurrence of what appears to be an accident in fact\nhad to happen. In short, there are no accidents (according to the\npopular meaning of accident) for Abner. \nThis deterministic description of the world (based on rational\narguments) resolves the theological problem of the contradiction\nbetween the free will of people and the foreknowledge of God. In the\nopinion of Abner free will does not really exist. For him, God is the\nfirst cause; He knows all the laws of the world and therefore knows\neverything that He has determined. \nThis deterministic description leads to two theological problems. The\nfirst is why God sent commandments to people who cannot truly decide\nwhether to obey them or disobey them. The second question that arises\nis how people can receive reward or punishment for actions and\ndecisions that they do not really have any control over? Abner answers\nthe second question by explaining that forbidden things are naturally\nbad. The punishment of the sinner is not a special act of divine\nprovidence; rather it is the natural consequence of his bad action.\nThis leads us to the answer to the first question. According to Abner,\nthe goal of the Torah is to influence people to do what is right. The\nTorah and prophets (and God who sent them) act in the world in\nconformity to His nature. The only way to influence someone to do\nsomething is to give him enough causes to do it. The Torah is only\nanother cause that influences people to do what is good. Abner\ncompares reward and punishment to a father that obligates his son to\ntake medication. The medicine will always work even if the son takes\nit unhappily. The same is true with regard to all actions of people.\nWhen people do what is right, they believe they will receive a reward,\nwhile if they do what is wrong, they believe they will receive a\npunishment\u2014even if they do not essentially have the choice to do\nanything else.  \nIt is interesting to note that this philosophical book that Abner\nwrote at the end of his life, more than twenty years after his\nconversion, is almost without Christian\n references.[17]\n In spite of this, the book is full of references to Jewish sources,\nincluding the Talmud and quotations of Jewish authorities like\n Maimonides.[18]\n We see that Abner, even many years after his conversion, wrote to the\nJewish community and was part of the internal Jewish debate about the\nquestion of determinism. In fact, Abner is the first medieval Jewish\nphilosopher to argue for a deterministic explanation of the world. His\nopinion influenced Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (who paraphrased an important\npart of Ofrenda de Zelos in his major philosophical work\nThe Light of the\n Lord[19]),\n and through him, Spinoza. Some Jewish philosophers, like Rabbi Isaac\nPulgar, Rabbi Mosses from Narbonne, and Rabbi Josef Ben Shem\n Tov[20]\n respond explicitly to the determinist opinion of Abner, such that\nthere is no doubt that his opinion had a major influence on the\ninternal Jewish debate on the question of free will throughout the\n14th and 15th centuries.

First, does ability indeed admit of some kind of modal\nanalysis? Second, if it does, how exactly are we to spell out the\ndetails of that analysis \u2014 in particular, how are we to\narticulate condition C? Let us begin with the first, more basic,\nquestion. \nAccording to (MA), performing an act at some possible world (or set of\nworlds) is both necessary and sufficient for having the ability to\nperform that act. One way of challenging this claim is to deny the\nnecessity claim: that is, to argue that it is sometimes the case that\nan agent is able to perform an act that she does not perform at any\npossible world. \nThis is an argument that has in fact been made by several authors.\nDescartes, for one, appears to have argued that God is such an agent\n(Curley 1984). A genuinely omnipotent being, one might argue, should\nbe able to perform any act whatsoever, even the impossible ones. This\nview of omnipotence is contentious, but it is not clear that it should\nbe ruled out formally, by the very analysis of ability, as (MA) does.\nSpencer (2017) argues that even non-omnipotent agents may sometimes\nhave the ability to perform acts that they do not perform at any\npossible world. \nLet us grant, however, that the possibility of performing an act is a\nnecessary condition for performing that act, and that in this sense an\nattribution of ability entails a possibility claim. One might\nnonetheless resist the view that ability admits of a modal analysis in\nthe manner suggested by (MA). \nThat is the kind of argument developed in a prescient discussion by\nAnthony Kenny (Kenny 1975; the presentation of Kenny here is indebted\nto the discussion in Brown 1988). Kenny argues that, if something like\n(MA) is indeed true, then ability should obey the principles that\ngovern the possibility operator in standard modal logics. Kenny claims\nthat ability\u00a0fails to satisfy the following two principles: \n(1) \\(A \\to \\Diamond A.\\)\n \nInformally, (1) expresses the principle that if an agent performs an\naction, then she has the ability to perform this action. This is,\nKenny argues, false of ability. \n(2) \\(\\Diamond(A \\lor B) \\to (\\Diamond A \\lor \\Diamond B).\\)\n \nInformally, (2) expresses the principle that if an agent has the\nability to perform one of two actions, then she has the ability to\nperform either the first action or the second action. This is, Kenny\nargues, false of ability. \nLet us begin with (1). Kenny claims that this principle is false in\nlight of cases like the following: \u2018A hopeless darts player may,\nonce in a lifetime, hit the bull, but be unable to repeat the\nperformance because he does not have the ability to hit the\nbull\u2019 (Kenny 1975, 136). This kind of \u2018fluky\nsuccess\u2019 has been extensively discussed in the philosophical\nliterature \u2014 perhaps most famously in Austin (1956) \u2014 in\norder to make a variety of points. Kenny\u2019s insight is to observe\nthat these simple cases tell against the modal analysis of ability, as\nthey violate an axiom of many modal logics, namely any system as\nstrong as the system T. \nA simple response to this point is to deny that T (or\nany stronger logic) is the correct logic for ability. To deny this is\nstill to allow for a treatment of ability within the framework of\npossible worlds. Notably, the modal logic K is one\nthat fails to validate (1). A natural response to Kenny\u2019s first\npoint, then, is to say that K, rather than\nT or some stronger system, is the correct modal logic\nof ability. \nThis response is not available, however, in response to Kenny\u2019s\nsecond objection. Recall that objection was that (2) is true of\npossibility but not of ability. Here the retreat to weaker modal\nlogics will not work, since (2) is provable on the weakest standard\nmodal logic, namely K. Yet the parallel claim does\nnot seem true of ability. Kenny gives the following example: \nGiven a pack of cards, I have the ability to pick out on request a\ncard which is either black or red; but I don\u2019t have the ability to\npick out a red card on request nor the ability to pick out a black\ncard on request. (Kenny 1975, 137)\n \nThis then appears to be a case where S has the ability to\nA or B but lacks the ability to A and lacks\nthe ability to B. So it appears that (2) is false of ability.\nIn light of this Kenny concludes that \u2018if we regard possible\nworlds semantics as making explicit what is involved in being a\npossibility, we must say that ability is not any kind of\npossibility\u2019 (Kenny 1975, 140). \nTo appreciate Kenny\u2019s conclusion, it is instructive to work\nthrough why precisely this is a counterexample to (MA). Consider an\nagent S who has the ability to pick a red card or a black\ncard, but does not have the ability to pick a red card or the ability\nto pick a black card. According to (MA), S has the ability\nto A iff S does A at some world (or set of\nworlds) satisfying condition C. Consider the case where (MA)\nappeals to a single world, not a set of worlds. If S has the\nability to pick a red card or pick a black card, then by (MA) there is\na world w satisfying condition C where S\npicks a red card or black card. Then either S picks a red\ncard at w or S picks a black card\nat w. Then, applying (MA) now in the other\ndirection, S has the ability to pick a red card or S\nhas the ability to pick a black card.  But that, by assumption, is not\nthe case. Since (MA) is the only substantive premise appealed to that\nargument, (MA) must be rejected. \nNote that this argument turned essentially on adopting the version of\n(MA) which appealed to a single world, rather than a set of worlds. So\none way of responding to this objection is by appealing to sets of\nworlds in the modal analysis of ability. This is precisely the\nproposal of Mark Brown, who argues that, if we take accessibility\nrelations to hold between a world and a set of worlds, then\u00a0we\nmay capture talk of ability within a possible worlds framework that is\nbroadly in the spirit of standard views (Brown 1988; see also Cross\n1986). Alternatively, we may take this sort of point to militate in\nfavor of a return to hypothetical theories of ability, since, at least\non Lewis\u2019s view of subjunctive conditionals, it may be that a\ndisjunction follows from a counterfactual claim without either of its\ndisjuncts following from that claim (Lewis 1973, 79\u201380). Modal\naccounts that appeal to sets of worlds are \u2018non-normal\u2019 in\nthe sense that they do not satisfy the axiom K, but\nthey remain true to the letter of (MA) as well as the spirit of modal\nanalyses generally, insofar as they avail themselves only of possible\nworlds and quantification thereover."},"4":{"chunk_id":"7feb2a7614ed39550f4d29f0a9cec5f8","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["4.

After the explication of this opinion and its\nnegation, Abner explains his deterministic opinion. Abner believed\nthat people have free will in a limited sense, but act in a determined\nway in the broader sense. People are free in their relation to\nthemselves, meaning that if a person is separated from the causes that\ninfluence him or her (e.g., education, society\u2019s influences) while\ndebating between two options, one is then really free to choose either\nof the two options.

However, if\none takes into account all the causes that influence his or her will,\nwe may conclude that these causes limits that person\u2019s will to only\none of the two options. In the opinion of Abner, people are like wax,\nas follows: Wax may be melted and sculpted into many different shapes.\nHowever, the person who sculpts the wax determines its present form as\nonly one of those options. The same is true about people: In\nthemselves, they have the ability to choose between different\npossibilities, but their relation to the outside world determines\ntheir choices.

Albeit not\na topic in its own right in the Buddha\u2019s discourses, the\ndoctrine of momentariness appears to have originated in conjunction\nwith the principle of impermanence (Skt., anitya, Pali,\nanicca). This idea is basic to the Buddha\u2019s\nempirically-oriented teaching about the nature of sentient experience:\nall physical and mental phenomena are in a constant process of\nconditioned construction and are interconnected, being dependently\noriginated (e.g., A I 286; M I 230, 336, 500;\nS II 26, III 24\u20135, 96\u20139, IV 214). The Suttanta\nelaboration on these three interlocking ideas results in a formula\n(A I 152) that states that conditioned phenomena (Skt.,\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101r\u0101, Pali,\nsa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101) are of the nature of origination\n(upp\u0101da), \u201cchange of what endures\u201d\n(\u1e6dhitassa a\u00f1\u00f1athatta), and dissolution or\ncessation (vaya). This formula is known as the \u201cthree\ncharacteristics of what is conditioned\u201d\n(tisa\u1e45khatalakkha\u1e47a). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika introduced four\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena: origination, endurance,\ndecay, and dissolution. These are classified under the dharma\ncategory of \u201cfactors dissociated from thought.\u201d \nThe Buddhist schools used the characteristics of conditioned phenomena\nas a hermeneutic tool with which to reinterpret impermanence in terms\nof momentariness. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nproposed a fully-fledged doctrine of momentariness according to which\nall physical and mental phenomena are momentary. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins use the term \u201cmoment\u201d\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47a) in a highly technical sense as the\nsmallest, definite unit of time that cannot be subdivided, the length\nof which came to be equated with the duration of mental events as the\nbriefest conceivable entities. There is no Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din\nconsensus on the length of a moment, but the texts indicate figures\nbetween 0.13 and 13 milliseconds in modern terms (Gethin 1998, 221;\nvon Rospatt 1995, 94\u2013110). This usage presupposes an atomistic\nconception of time, for time is not reckoned indefinitely divisible.\nIndeed, the term k\u1e63a\u1e47a is often discussed in\njuxtaposition to the concepts of material atoms and syllables, which\nare likewise comprehended as indivisible. \nWithin the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, material reality\n(r\u016bpa-dharma) is reduced to discrete momentary atoms,\nand much attention is drawn to ontological and epistemological\nquestions such as whether sense objects are real at any time, or\nwhether atoms contribute separately or collectively to the generation\nof perception. Atomic reality is understood as constantly changing:\nwhat appears to us as a world made up of enduring substances with\nchanging qualities is, in fact, a series of moments that arise and\nperish in rapid succession. This process is not random, but operates\nin accordance with the specific capability and function of each atom.\nThe spirit of this atomistic analysis of material reality applies\nequally to mental reality: consciousness is understood as a succession\nof discrete consciousness moments that arise and cease extremely\n rapidly.[10]\n Thus, the ratio of change between material and mental phenomena in\nany given moment is one to one: they occur in perfect synchronicity\n(Kim 1999, 54). On this point the Sautr\u0101ntika agreed with the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da. \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that\nall things exist\u201d) were unique in their stance that the\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena exist separately as real\nentities within each moment. Their claim, then, is that all\nconditioned dharmas\u2014whether past, present, or\nfuture\u2014exist as real entities (dravyatas) within the\nspan of any given moment. This induced a host of problems, one of\nwhich is that the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da definition of a moment is\ndifficult to reconcile with its conception as the shortest unit of\ntime (von Rospatt 1995, 44\u201346 & 97\u201398). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da replies to this criticism by stating that the\nactivities (k\u0101ritra) of the four characteristics of\nconditioned phenomena are sequential: the limits between the birth and\ndissolution of any event are referred to as one moment. This solution,\nhowever, implies that a single event undergoes four phases within a\ngiven moment, which inevitably infringes upon its momentariness (Cox\n1995, 151; von Rospatt 1995, 52ff). \nThe Therav\u0101dins created their own distinct version of the\ndoctrine of momentariness. They do not seem to have been as concerned\nas the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins with the ontology and epistemology of\nmaterial and mental realities per se. Rather, they were more\npreoccupied with the psychological apparatus governing the process of\ncognizing of sense data, and hence with the changing ratio between\nmaterial and mental phenomena. The Yamaka of the canonical\nAbhidhamma offers what is probably the first textual occurrence of the\nterm \u201cmoment\u201d (kha\u1e47a) in the sense of a\nvery brief stretch of time that is divided into origination and\ncessation instants (Kim 1999, 60\u201361). Relying on the three\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena, the Pali commentaries later\npresent a scheme wherein each moment of every phenomenon is subdivided\ninto three different instants of origination\n(upp\u0101dakkha\u1e47a), endurance\n(\u1e6dhitikkha\u1e47a) and cessation\n(bha\u1e45gakkha\u1e47a) (Spk II 266;\nMp II 252). These are three phases of a single momentary\nphenomenon defined as one single dhamma or consciousness\nmoment. A dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second, and ceases in the third (Karunadasa 2010, 234ff). The\ncommentarial tradition thus analyzes phenomena temporally by\ndissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events that\nfall away as soon as they have originated in consciousness. As one\nevent is exhausted, it conditions a new event of its kind that\nproceeds immediately afterwards. The result is an uninterrupted,\nflowing continuum (sant\u0101na) of causally connected\nmomentary events. These succeed each other so fast that we conceive of\nthe phenomena they constitute as temporally extended. \nThe Therav\u0101dins use the term kha\u1e47a as the\nexpression for a brief instant, the dimension of which is not fixed\nbut may be determined by the context. For example,\ncittakkha\u1e47a refers to the instant taken by one\nmental event. In this basic sense as denoting a very brief stretch of\ntime, the term \u201cmoment\u201d does not entail an atomistic\nconception of a definite and ultimate, smallest unit of time, but\nleaves open the possibility that time is infinitely divisible (von\nRospatt 1995, 59\u201360 & 94\u201395). Here the three moments\nof origination, endurance, and cessation do not correspond to three\ndifferent entities. Rather, they represent three phases of a single\nmomentary phenomenon and are defined as one single consciousness\nmoment: a dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second sub-moment and perishes in the third one. In this way, the\nTherav\u0101dins avoided some of the difficulties faced by the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, of how to compress the\ncharacteristics of the conditioned into one single indivisible moment\nand of how to account for their ontological status. The\nTherav\u0101dins also claimed that only mental phenomena are\nmomentary, whereas material phenomena (e.g., common-sense objects)\nendure for a stretch of time. The Therav\u0101din commentarial\ntradition subsequently elaborated on this proposition and produced a\nunique view of the ratio between material and mental phenomena,\nasserting that a material phenomenon lasts for sixteen or seventeen\nconsciousness moments (Kv 620; Vibh-a 25\u201328;\nVism XX 24\u201326; Kim 1999, 79\u201380 &\n\u00a73.1). \nDespite their different interpretations of the concept of\nmomentariness, the early Buddhist schools all derived this concept\nfrom the analysis of impermanence in terms of the dynamics of\ndharmas qua physical and mental events. The equation of a\nmoment with the duration of these transient events as extremely short\noccurrences\u2014even the shortest conceivable\u2014led to the\ndirect determination of the moment in terms of these occurrences. Yet\nthe doctrine of momentariness spawned a host of problems for the\nBuddhist schools, particularly with regard to the status of the\nendurance moment and to the explanation of continuity and conditioning\ninteraction among the dharmas (see section 5 below). If\ndharmas go through an endurance phase or exist as real\nentities within the span of any given moment, how can they be\nmomentary? And if experience is an array of strictly momentary\ndharmas, how can continuity and causal conditioning be\npossible? \nOne might argue that the conceptual shift from\n\u201cimpermanence\u201d to \u201cendurance\u201d is a result of\nscholastic literalism and testifies to the Abhidharma tendency towards\nreification and hypostatization of dharmas (Gombrich 1996,\n36\u201337, 96\u201397 & 106\u2013107). Nevertheless, the\nobject of the doctrine of momentariness is not so much existence in\ntime or the passage of time per se, but rather, in epistemological\nterms and a somewhat Bergsonian sense, the construction of temporal\nexperience. Instead of a transcendental matrix of order imposed on\nnatural events from without, time is seen as an inherent feature of\nthe operation of dharmas. The doctrine of momentariness\nanalyzes dharmas as they transpire through time: as\npsycho-physical events that arise and cease in consciousness and, by\nthe dynamics of their rise and fall, construct time. The sequence of\nthe three times is therefore secondary, generated in and by the\nprocess of conditioned and conditioning dharmas. In fact, the\nconceptual shift from the principle of impermanence to the theory of\nmomentariness is a shift in time scales.

This is the view\ndeveloped in a series of papers by Angelika Kratzer (Kratzer 2012).\nKratzer treats expressions such as \u2018S\ncan A\u2019 and \u2018S is able\nto A\u2019 as possibility claims. That is, \u2018S\nis able to A\u2019 is true just in case there is a possible\nworld w meeting certain conditions at which S\ndoes A. The conditions are that (i) w be accessible\ngiven some contextually-specified set of facts (the\nmodal base) and (ii) that w be at least as good,\naccording to a contextually-specified ranking of worlds\n(the ordering source), as any other accessible world. The\nKratzer semantics is thus an instance of the modal analysis on its\nsemantic formulation: \n(MAsemantic) \u2018S is able to A\u2019\nis true iff S does A at some world (or set of\nworlds) satisfying condition C.\n \nA number of objection have been brought against the modal analysis in\nthis latter, formal, aspect. \nOne objection prominent in the recent literature (Mandelkern et al.\n2017; Schwarz 2020) is that Kratzer\u2019s semantics, or any analysis\nof the form of (MAsemantic), appears to have trouble\nmarking an intuitive distinction between what someone is able to do\nand what it is possible for her to do. Let us say that an unskilled\ndarts-player is about to throw a dart. She utters: \n(3) I am able to hit the bullseye\n \nIntuitively, what she says is false: she is not able to hit the\nbullseye, as she is a poor darts-player. Yet there is an accessible\nand perfectly good possible world w at which she hits the\nbullseye \u2014 which is just to say, in the object language, that it\nis possible for her to hit the bullseye. \nThis case suggests the Kratzer semantics lacks the resources to\ncapture the distinctively agentive force of a sentences such as (3).\nThere are, in addition, a number of other outstanding empirical\nproblems for Kratzer\u2019s semantics for ability modals. One is the\nproblem of accounting for \u2018compulsion\u2019 modals such as\n\u2018I cannot but tell the truth\u2019 (Mandelkern et al. 2017).\nAnother is that of accommodating the \u2018actuality\nentailment\u2019 whereby, in many languages, certain ability\nsentences entail that the act in question was actually performed\n(Bhatt 1999; see also Hacquard 2009). Whatever our verdict on\n(MAsemantic), the semantics of ability-ascriptions remains\nan unresolved and potentially rich issue at the boundary of\nlinguistics and the philosophy of action."},"4":{"chunk_id":"4eb8602daf3c6ed8c0891cafb21555bb","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["4.

To do so, he relies on\nthe traditional division, derived from Aristotle, that sees the main\nlinguistic categories as name, verb, and their\ncombination into the sentence. \nAbelard takes names to be conventionally significant simple words,\nusually without tense. So understood there are a wide variety of\nnames: proper and common names; adjectives and adverbs; pronouns,\nwhether personal, possessive, reflexive, or relative; conventional\ninterjections such as \u2018Goodness!\u2019; and, arguably,\nconjunctions and prepositions (despite lacking definite\nsignification), along with participles and gerundives (which have\ntense). Abelard usually, though not always, treats compound names such\nas \u2018street-sweeper\u2019 reductively. Even so his list is not\ngeneral enough to catalogue all referring expressions. In point of\nfact, much of Abelard\u2019s discussion of the semantics of names\nturns on a particular case that stands for the rest: common names.\nThese are at the heart of the problem of universals, and they pose\nparticular difficulties for semantics. \nWhen Abelard puts forward his claim that universality is only a\nlinguistic phenomenon, so that universals are \u201cnothing more than\nwords,\u201d he raises the objection that unless common names are the\nnames of common items, they will be meaningless, and so his view is no\nbetter than that of his teacher Roscelin (who held that universals\nwere mere mouth noises). In reply Abelard clearly draws a distinction\nbetween two semantic properties names possess: reference\n(nominatio), a matter of what the term applies to; and sense\n(significatio), a matter of what hearing the term brings to\nmind, or more exactly the informational content (doctrina) of\nthe concept the word is meant to give rise to, a causal notion. A few\nremarks about each are in order. \nNames, both proper and common, refer to things individually or\nseverally. A name is linked with that of which it is the name as\nthough there were someone who devised the name to label a given thing\nor kind of thing, a process known as \u201cimposition\u201d\n(modelled on Adam\u2019s naming the animals in Genesis 2:19), rather\nlike baptism. This rational reconstruction of reference does not\nrequire the person imposing the name, the \u201cimpositor\u201d, to\nhave anything more than an indefinite intention to pick out the thing\nor kind of thing, whatever its nature may be: \nThe inventor [of names] intended to impose them according to some\nnatures or distinctive properties of things, even if he himself did\nnot know how to think correctly upon the nature or distinctive\nproperty of a thing.\n \nA name \u201chas a definition in the nature of its imposition, even\nif we do not know what it is.\u201d Put in modern terms, Abelard\nholds a theory of direct reference, in which the extension of\na term is not a function of its sense. We are often completely\nignorant of the proper conceptual content that should be associated\nwith a term that has been successfully imposed. \nA proper name\u2014the name of a primary substance\u2014signifies a\nconcrete individual (hoc aliquid), picking out its bearer as\npersonally distinct from all else. Therefore, proper names are\nsemantically singular referring expressions, closely allied to\nindexicals, demonstratives, and singular descriptions (or descriptive\nterms). Common names, by contrast, are semantically allied with\nexpressions that have what Abelard calls \u201cplural\nsignification\u201d. On the one hand, common names are like plural\nnouns; the common name \u2018man\u2019 is grammatically singular but\noperates like the plural term \u2018men\u2019\u2014each refers to\nevery man, although the plural term signifies individuals as part of a\ncollection, whereas the common name distributively refers to each\nindividual. On the other hand, common names are like terms such as\n\u2018trio\u2019 or \u2018pair\u2019 in that they pick out a\ndeterminate plurality of individuals, but only on an occasion of use,\nsince their extension is variable. \nThus a common name distributively refers to concrete individuals,\nthough not to them qua individuals. Instead, it severally\npicks out those individuals having a given nature: \u2018human\nbeing\u2019 refers to Socrates and to Plato, in virtue of each of\nthem being human. This is not a shared feature of any sort; Socrates\njust is what he is, namely human, and likewise Plato is what he is,\nnamely human too. Abelard states his deflationary position clearly in\nhis Logica \u2018ingredientibus\u2019: \nNow it seems we should stay away from accepting the agreement among\nthings according to what is not any thing\u2014it\u2019s as though\nwe were to unite in nothing things that now exist!\u2014namely, when\nwe say that this [human] and that one agree in the human status, that\nis to say: in that they are human. But we mean precisely that they are\nhuman and don\u2019t differ in this regard\u2014let me repeat: [they\ndon\u2019t differ] in that they are human, although we\u2019re not\nappealing to any thing [in this explanation].\n \nSocrates and Plato are real; their agreement is real, too, but it\nisn\u2019t to be explained by appealing to any thing\u2014their\nagreement just is their each being human. From a metaphysical point of\nview they have the same standing as human beings; this does not\ninvolve any metaphysically common shared ingredient, or indeed appeal\nto any ingredient at all. That is the sense in which there is a\n\u201ccommon reason\u201d for the imposition of a common name.  \nFor all that signification is posterior to reference, names do have\nsignification as well. Abelard holds that the signification of a term\nis the informational content of the concept that is associated with\nthe term upon hearing it, in the normal course of events. Since names\nare only conventionally significant, which concept is associated with\na given name depends in part on the psychological conditioning of\nlanguage-users, in virtue of which Abelard can treat signification as\nboth a causal and a normative notion: the word \u2018rabbit\u2019\nought to cause native speakers of English to have the concept of a\nrabbit upon hearing it. Abelard is careful to insist that the\nsignification is a matter of the informational content carried in the\nconcept\u2014mere psychological associations, even the mental images\ncharacteristic of a given concept, are not part of what the word\nmeans. Ideally, the concept will correspond to a real\ndefinition that latches onto the nature of the thing, the way\n\u2018rational mortal animal\u2019 is thought to be the real\ndefinition of \u2018human being\u2019, regardless of other\nassociated features (even necessary features such as risibility) or\nfortuitous images (as any mental image of a human will be of someone\nwith determinate features). Achieving such clarity in our concepts is,\nof course, an arduous business, and requires an understanding of how\nunderstanding itself works (see the discussion of Abelard\u2019s\nphilosophy of mind in\n Section 5).\n Yet one point should be clear from the example. The significations of\nsome names, such as those corresponding to natural-kind terms, are\nabstractions in the sense that they include only certain features of\nthe things to which the term refers. They do not positively exclude\nall other features, though, and are capable of further determinate\nspecification: \u2018rational mortal animal\u2019 as the content of\nthe concept of \u2018human being\u2019 signifies all humans,\nwhatever their further features may be\u2014tall or short, fat or\nthin, male or female, and so on. \nWhat holds for the semantics of names applies for the most part to\nverbs. The feature that sets verbs apart from names, more so than\ntense or grammatical person, is that verbs have connective force\n(vis copulativa). This is a primitive and irreducible feature\nof verbs that can only be discharged when they are joined with names\nin the syntactically appropriate way, reminiscent of the\n\u2018unsaturatedness\u2019 of concepts in Frege. Sentences are made\nup of names and verbs in such a way that the meaning of the whole\nsentence is a function of the meaning of its parts. That is,\nAbelardian semantics is fundamentally compositional in nature. The\ndetails of how the composition works are complex. Abelard works\ndirectly with a natural language (Latin) that, for all its\nartificiality, is still a native second tongue. Hence there are many\nlinguistic phenomena Abelard is compelled to analyze that would be\nsimply disallowed in a more formal framework. \nFor example, Abelard notes that most verbs can occur as predicates in\ntwo ways, namely as a finite verbal form or as a nominal form combined\nwith an auxiliary copula, so that we may say either \u2018Socrates\nruns\u2019 or \u2018Socrates is running\u2019; the same holds for\ntransitive predication, for instance \u2018Socrates hits Plato\u2019\nand \u2018Socrates is hitting Plato.\u2019 Abelard argues that in\ngeneral the pure verbal version of predication is the fundamental\nform, which explains and clarifies the extended version; the latter is\nonly strictly necessary where simple verbal forms are lacking. (The\nsubstantive verb \u2018is\u2019 requires special treatment.) Hence\nfor Abelard the basic analysis of a predicative statement recognizes\nthat two fundamentally different linguistic categories are joined\ntogether: the name n and the simple verbal function\nV( ), combined in the well-formed sentence\nV(n). \nAbelard argues that sentences (propositiones) must signify\nmore than just the understandings of the constituent name and verb.\nFirst, a sentence such as \u2018Socrates runs\u2019 deals with\nSocrates and with running, not with anyone\u2019s understandings. We\ntalk about the world, not merely someone\u2019s understanding of the\nworld. Second, sentences like \u2018If something is human, it is an\nanimal\u2019 are false if taken to be about understandings, for\nsomeone could entertain the concept human without\nentertaining the concept animal, and so the antecedent would\nobtain without the consequent. Third, understandings are evanescent\nparticulars, mere mental tokenings of concepts. But at least some\nconsequential sentences are necessary, and necessity can\u2019t be\ngrounded on things that are transitory, and so not on understandings.\nSentences must therefore signify something else in addition to\nunderstandings, something that can do what mere understandings cannot.\nAbelard describes this as signifying what the sentence says, calling\nwhat is said by the sentence its dictum (plural\ndicta). \nTo the modern philosophical ear, Abelard\u2019s dicta might\nsound like propositions, abstract entities that are the timeless\nbearers of truth and falsity. But Abelard will have nothing to do with\nany such entities. He declares repeatedly and emphatically that\ndespite being more than and different from the sentences that express\nthem, dicta have no ontological standing whatsoever. In the\nshort space of a single paragraph he says that they are \u201cno real\nthings at all\u201d and twice calls them \u201cabsolutely\nnothing.\u201d They underwrite sentences, but they aren\u2019t real\nthings. For although a sentence says something, there is not some\nthing that it says. The semantic job of sentences is to say\nsomething, which is not to be confused with naming or denoting some\nthing. It is instead a matter of proposing how things are, provided\nthis is not given a realist reading. Likewise, the truth of true\nsentences is not a property inhering in some timeless entity, but no\nmore than the assertion of what the sentence says\u2014that is,\nAbelard adopts a deflationary account of truth. A sentence is true if\nthings stand in the way it says, and things make sentences true or\nfalse in virtue of the way they are (as well as in virtue of what the\nsentences say), and nothing further is required. The sentence\n\u2018Socrates runs\u2019 is true because Socrates runs, which is\nall that can be said or needs to be said."},"2":{"chunk_id":"b1de0adb74a7a3e590a6d48bda49e946","article_title":"Abhidharma","section_path":["3.

Fara"],"concepts":["Vihvelin","PAP","Major League","Clarke","CA","Sections 3\u20135","the Principle of Alternative Possibilities","Smith (2003","MA"],"content":"\nIn recent years several authors have revisited the thought that we may\ngive a broadly hypothetical account of ability, without endorsing the\nproblematic claim (CA). This is the view of ability that has been\ndefended by Smith (2003), Vihvelin (2004, 2013), and Fara\n(2008). Following Clarke (2009), we may label this view the\n\u2018new dispositionalism.\u2019 \nWhat unifies the new dispositionalists is that they return to the\nconditional analysis of ability in light of two thoughts. The first\nthought is one already noted: that there is a variety of power,\ndispositions, that is similar in many respects to abilities. The\nsecond thought is that there are well-known problems of giving a\nconditional analysis of dispositions, in light of which many\nauthors have been inclined to reject the long-assumed link between\ndispositions and conditionals. Taken together, these thoughts yield a\npromising new line on abilities: that though we ought to reject the\nconditional analysis of abilities, we may yet defend a\ndispositional account of abilities. \nWhy ought we reject the conditional analysis of dispositions? Consider\nthe following analysis of the disposition to break when struck: \n(CD) x is disposed to break when struck iff S would\nbreak if S were struck.\n \nDespite the intuitive appeal of (CD), there appear to be at least two\nkinds of counterexamples to it. First, consider a crystal glass that,\nif it were about to be struck, would transform into steel. This glass\nis disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would\nbreak if struck\u2014the transformation renders this false. This is a\ncase of finking, in the language of Martin 1994. Second,\nconsider a crystal glass stuffed with styrofoam packaging. This glass\nis disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would\nbreak if struck\u2014the packaging prevents this. This is a case of\nmasking, in the language of Johnston 1992. In light of such\ncases, it seems we ought to reject (CD). \nThe bearing of these points on our earlier discussion of the\nconditional analysis is the following. There appear to be quite\ngeneral problems for giving a conditional analysis of powers.\nSo it may be that the failures of the conditional analysis of ability\nwere not due to any fact about abilities, but rather to a shortcoming\nof conditional analyses generally. One way of overcoming this problem,\nif this diagnosis is correct, is to analyze abilities directly in\nterms of dispositions. \nSuch an analysis is proposed by Fara 2008, who argues: \nS has the ability to A in circumstances C\niff she has the disposition to A when, in circumstances\nC, she tries to A. (Fara 2008, 848)\n \nThe similarity of this analysis to the hypothetical analyses canvassed\nearlier are clear. This raises several immediate questions, such as\nwhether this analysis can overcome the problem of sufficiency that\nplagued those approaches (see Fara 2008, 851\u2013852 for an\naffirmative answer, and Clarke 2009, 334\u2013336 for some doubts).\nWhat is most striking about the new dispositionalists, however, is how\nthey bring this sort of account of ability to bear on certain familiar\ncases. \nConsider how the new dispositionalism bears on so-called\n\u2018Frankfurt cases.\u2019\u00a0These are cases due to Frankfurt\n1969, where an agent chooses to and performs some action A\nwhile at the same time there is some other action B such\nthat, had the agent been about to choose B, an\n\u2018intervener\u2019 would have altered the agent\u2019s brain so\nthat the agent would have chosen, and performed, A instead.\nOne question about such cases is whether the agent, in the actual\nsequence of events, had the ability to B. Frankfurt\u2019s\nintuition, and that of most others, is that she did not. Given the\nfurther claim that the agent is nonetheless morally responsible for\ndoing A, this case appears to be a counterexample to the what\nFrankfurt calls the Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP): an\nagent is morally responsible for Aing only if she had the\nability to perform some action other than A. \nThe new dispositionalists disagree. Let us focus on Fara\u2019s\ndiagnosis of the case. The question of whether the agent had the\nability to B turns, for Fara, on the question of whether she\nwas disposed to B when she tried to B. Fara\nclaims\u00a0that she does have such a disposition. The\npresence of the intervener is, on Fara\u2019s view, like the\naforementioned styrofoam packaging in a crystal glass. It\nmasks the disposition of the glass to break when struck, but\ndoes not remove that disposition. Similarly, Fara argues, the\npresence of the intervener masks the agent\u2019s disposition\nto B when she tries to B, but does not\nremove that disposition. (There is some disagreement among\nthe new dispositionalists about whether this is a case of finking or\nmasking; see Clarke 2009, 340 for discussion). So, pace\nFrankfurt, the agent does have the ability to B after all.\nAnd so we have, in this case at least, no counterexample to PAP. \nA natural worry at this point is that the new dispositionalist has\nsimply changed the subject. For it seems clear that,\u00a0in\na perfectly ordinary sense of ability, Frankfurt\u2019s agent\nlacks the ability to do otherwise. An account of ability\nwhich denies this seems to be speaking of some other concept\naltogether. One way of bringing out what is missing is the idea that\nthere seems to be a connection between my abilities, in the sense of\nability that is relevant to free will, and what is up to me.\nClarke claims\u00a0that this sort of connection fails on the new\ndispositionalist view of ability: \nAlthough the presence of a fink or mask that would prevent one\u2019s\nAing is compatible with having a general capacity (the\nunimpaired competence to A), there is an ordinary sense in\nwhich in such circumstances an agent might well be unable to\nA \u2026 If there is something in place that would prevent\nme from Aing should I try to A, if it is not up to\nme that it would so prevent me, and if it is not up to me that such a\nthing is in place, then even if I have a capacity to A, it is\nnot up to me whether I exercise that capacity. (Clarke 2009, 339)\n \nThus the objection is that, while the new dispositionalist has perhaps\noffered a theory of something, it is not a theory of\nability. \nHow should the new dispositionalist respond? One thought is that we\nare here again encountering the distinction between general and\nspecific abilities. The new dispositionalist might contend that, while\nthe agent in a Frankfurt case may lack the specific ability to do\notherwise, she has the general ability to do otherwise, and that it is\nthis general ability of which the new dispositionalist is giving an\naccount. \nThis response, however, postpones a crucial and much broader question.\nThe question is this: should \u2018ability\u2019 in (PAP) be\nunderstood as general ability, or specific ability? If general ability\nis what matters, then Frankfurt cases may indeed not tell against\n(PAP), for the agent retains the general ability to do otherwise. If\nit is specific ability that matters, however,\u00a0the challenge to\n(PAP) stands (see also Whittle 2010). This is a vital question for\nunderstanding the purported connection between agents\u2019 abilities\nand questions of moral responsibility, whatever our verdict on new\ndispositionalism itself. (See Cyr and Swenson 2019\u00a0for a helpful\nrecent discussion of these issues)."},"4":{"chunk_id":"0ce5d802a5eaca2527f097ebaa581b2d","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["5.

We can still try to reconstruct some of his\nscientific opinions through some parts of his other works,\nspecifically the existing work Meyasher Aqob, Rabbi Isaac\nPulgar\u2019s brief summary of the lost work, and some scientific passages\nin Mostrador de\n Justicia.[21] \nThe first interesting opinion of Abner is his view on prime matter.\nAbner denied a necessary link, which the Aristotelians affirmed,\nbetween bodies and accidents (magnitude, weight, quantity, etc.),\nmaintaining that a body untainted by all these accidents can\nnonetheless have actual existence. He explicated his view in the\ndogmatic context of the question of the rite of\n Mass.[22]\n The rebel\u2019s main philosophical arguments against the Mass are as\nfollows: (1) How can several bodies occupy the same place? (2) How can\nJesus\u2019 body be in the bread and wine without changing them? (3) How\ncan the same body be two different materials at the same time? (4) How\ncan one debase Jesus by eating and digesting him? At the start of his\nanswer Abner emphasizes that the Mass is miraculous. Nevertheless, he\ndoes go on to offer a scientific explanation of transubstantiation.\nFor Abner, everybody has a layer of pure divine existence, to which\nare superadded other forms and accidents; but if the body is stripped\nof all of these accretions it will be reduced to the original divine\nsubstance only. In this state the body will have no boundary,\nquantity, or weight to occupy the universe, and consequently is\ninfinite. This body is the foundation of the entire material world,\nand normally\u2014with the exception of the sacrament of the Mass and\nIncarnation\u2014it does not exist without accidents (at least not in\nthe sublunary world). This matter is identified with the flesh of\nJesus, which has divine existence only, which means that Jesus\u2019 body\nis identified with prime matter. \nThe above description eliminates for Abner all of the difficulties\nposed by the rebel. The problem of the co-presence of two bodies in\none place is eliminated, because all bodies, once they have been\nstripped of their form and accidents, incorporate the infinite body of\nJesus, which fills the entire universe. After these forms have been\nremoved, the bread and wine are identified with Jesus\u2019 body. The very\nsame principle eliminates the problem of the simultaneous existence of\nJesus\u2019 body in several places, since his body fills the entire\nuniverse and transcends all definitions of place. Because his body\nalso transcends the definition of quantity, the problem of limited\nquantity is removed as well. \nAnother subject about which Abner critiques Aristotelian science is\nthe definition of place and the relation between place and body. In\nthe thought of Aristotle, the definition of place is \u2018the limit\nof the encompassing body\u2019. In his opinion, place has an\nimportant role in movement. The definition of a natural movement is\nthe movement of a body to its natural place in the world. Aristotle\nexplains that both the natural place attracts the body and that the\nbody moves on his own to its natural place. \nAbner distinguishes between the physical object and extension or\ndimension. According to Abner, dimension is \u201ca simple and subtle\nquantity detached from all movable bodies\u201d; in other words, it\nis space, independent of any physical body. Dimension is measurable\nper se, and is not linked to what occupies it. Nevertheless, Abner\u2019s\ndefinition of place is still associated with body: \u201cplace\u201d\nis the dimension occupied by a body, and it is the body that turns it\ninto \u201cplace.\u201d According to Abner, the movement of bodies\nis not due to their being attracted to some place where they must rest\nbefore resuming their movement; rather, they move because of the\ninteraction of several forces, quite independent of any particular\nplace. A body that is thrown upward rises, but if it suddenly begins\nto fall because of an opposing force, there would not be a moment of\nrest between the two opposing motions. \nThus Abner dismisses Aristotle\u2019s concept that a body is attracted to\nits natural place. Different places are not characterized by different\nqualities (inasmuch as all places are equal and are merely points in\nspace). Hence a body has no cause to move to a particular place and no\nplace is a final cause of its motion. \nWe know from Rabbi Isaac Pulgar that Abner also criticized the\nopinions of Aristotle on the possibility of a void and argues for the\nexistence of voids in his lost scientific book The New\nPhilosophy. Because of the influence of Abner on Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas, we can assume that his criticism is closely related to the\ncriticism of Crescas in the beginning of the first speech of Or\nHashem \nAbner wrote his criticism of Artistotelian science at the beginning of\nthe 14th century, approximately the same time that Ockham\nwrote his criticism of this science. In the writing and the thought of\nAbner we do not see any kind of influence of Ockham or of other late\nscholastics (the only scholastic philosopher that he cites is Thomas\nAquinas and there are no quotations from Christian sources on a\nscientific subject). It is interesting to note that the systematic\ncriticism of Aristotelian science started approximately at the same\ntime in the Jewish milieu (with the writings of Abner) and in the\nChristian milieu, with probably no relation one to the other. \nAbner\u2019s criticism of Aristotelian science had an important influence\non Crescas\u2019s thought, and through him to Pico Della Mirandola and\ngeneral Western philosophy."}},"24":{"0":{"chunk_id":"6ae1afd1662837a0294f1ac43b46c62c","article_title":"Abduction","section_path":["3.

Rather, they were more\npreoccupied with the psychological apparatus governing the process of\ncognizing of sense data, and hence with the changing ratio between\nmaterial and mental phenomena. The Yamaka of the canonical\nAbhidhamma offers what is probably the first textual occurrence of the\nterm \u201cmoment\u201d (kha\u1e47a) in the sense of a\nvery brief stretch of time that is divided into origination and\ncessation instants (Kim 1999, 60\u201361).

An alternative account of abilities might give an\naccount of abilities in terms of some other kind of power, perhaps one\nbetter-suited to the distinctive aspects of abilities. \nOne account of this kind is developed in a series of works by Barbara\nVetter (especially Vetter 2015). Vetter proposes that our basic modal\nnotion should be potentiality. On a traditional view (which\nVetter rejects) dispositions involve a dyadic relation between a\nstimulus and a manifestation (for example: a glass is disposed to\nbreak when struck). In contrast, potentials involve a monadic relation\nto a manifestation (for example: a glass has the potential to break).\nThis makes potentials especially well-suited to give an account of\nabilities, which also appear to involve a monadic relation to an act,\nnamely the act denoted by the complement of an ability-ascription (for\nexample: I am able to play tennis). To have an ability, Vetter argues,\nis simply to have a certain kind of potentiality. Vetter also provides\nan explicit semantics for agentive modality in terms of the ascription\nof potentiality (Vetter 2013), which constitutes a systematic\nalternative to (MA). \nYet another view is suggested by recent work by Helen Steward\nemphasizing the traditional idea of a \u2018two-way power\u2019\n(Steward 2012, Steward 2020; see also Alvarez 2013). Steward argues\nthat actions are exercises of two-way powers \u2014 \u2018powers\nwhich an agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all\nprior conditions at that moment fixed\u2019 (Steward 2020, 345).\nThese are to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest\nwhenever their manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile\nglass breaks whenever it is struck. Unlike both the new\ndispositionalists on the one hand and Vetter on the other, Steward\nsees a fundamental asymmetry between agents, who are bearers of\ntwo-way powers, and mere objects, who are are bearers only of one-way\npowers. It is natural then to think that what it is to have an ability\nis to have a two-way power of a certain kind, and that a theory of\nability should follow from an account of agency and the two-way\npowers. \nWe thus have at least three \u2018power-based\u2019 views of\nabilities: the new dispositionalism, Vetter\u2019s potentiality-based\nview, and Steward\u2019s two-way power-based view. It is instructive\nto consider how these three accounts differ with respect to two larger\nphilosophical projects. \nOne is the project of giving an analysis of modal language, including\nability-ascriptions, in terms of possible worlds. The new\ndispositionalist rejects (CA) and (MA) but she is still, in principle,\nsympathetic with that project, insofar as she allows that disposition\nascriptions themselves may be ultimately understood in terms of\nquantification over possible worlds. This kind of view is explicitly\nendorsed, for instance, by Smith (2003). In contrast, Vetter is\nexplicitly opposed to this project, while Steward\u2019s view appears\nneutral on this question. \nAnother is the project of arguing that agents\u2019 abilities are, or\nare not, compatible with the possibility of determinism. This is a\nquestion we touched on briefly in Section 5.1. As noted there, the new\ndispositionalists are motivated, in part, by the project of arguing\nfor compatibilism. In contrast, Steward is explicitly concerned to\ndefend incompatibilism. (Vetter appears to be neutral on this\nquestion.) The question of how the analysis of ability bears on the\nfree will debates looms over many of these discussions, and we will\nconfront it directly and at some length below in Section 6."},"4":{"chunk_id":"41680a5fff2cb0a2b1a0dc68bd5ce5e1","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["5.

We here\nconsider two objections that are meant to be more general. The first\neven purports to challenge the core idea underlying abduction; the\nsecond is not quite as general, but it is still meant to undermine a\nbroad class of candidate explications of abduction. Both objections\nare due to Bas van Fraassen. \nThe first objection has as a premise that it is part of the meaning of\n\u201cexplanation\u201d that if one theory is more explanatory than\nanother, the former must be more informative than the latter (see,\ne.g., van Fraassen 1983, Sect. 2). The alleged problem then is that it\nis \u201can elementary logical point that a more informative theory\ncannot be more likely to be true [and thus] attempts to describe\ninductive or evidential support through features that require\ninformation (such as \u2018Inference to the Best Explanation\u2019)\nmust either contradict themselves or equivocate\u201d (van Fraassen\n1989, 192). The elementary logical point is supposed to be \u201cmost\n[obvious] \u2026 in the paradigm case in which one theory is an\nextension of another: clearly the extension has more ways of being\nfalse\u201d (van Fraassen 1985, 280). \nIt is important to note, however, that in any other kind of case than\nthe \u201cparadigm\u201d one, the putative elementary point is not\nobvious at all. For instance, it is entirely unclear in what sense\nSpecial Relativity Theory \u201chas more ways of being false\u201d\nthan Lorentz\u2019s version of the \u00e6ther theory, given that\nthey make the same predictions. And yet the former is generally\nregarded as being superior, qua explanation, to the latter.\n(If van Fraassen were to object that the former is not really more\ninformative than the latter, or at any rate not more informative in\nthe appropriate sense\u2014whatever that is\u2014then we should\ncertainly refuse to grant the premise that in order to be more\nexplanatory a theory must be more informative.) \nThe second objection, proffered in van Fraassen 1989 (Ch. 6), is\nlevelled at probabilistic versions of abduction. The objection is that\nsuch rules must either amount to Bayes\u2019 rule, and thus be\nredundant, or be at variance with it but then, on the grounds of\nLewis\u2019 dynamic Dutch book argument (as reported in Teller 1973),\nbe probabilistically incoherent, meaning that they may lead one to\nassess as fair a number of bets which together ensure a financial\nloss, come what may; and, van Fraassen argues, it would be irrational\nto follow a rule that has this feature. \nHowever, this objection fares no better than the first. For one thing,\nas Patrick Maher (1992) and Brian Skyrms (1993) have pointed out, a\nloss in one respect may be outweighed by a benefit in another. It\nmight be, for instance, that some probabilistic version of abduction\ndoes much better, at least in our world, than Bayes\u2019 rule, in\nthat, on average, it approaches the truth faster in the sense that it\nis faster in assigning a high probability (understood as probability\nabove a certain threshold value) to the true hypothesis (see Douven\n2013, 2020, and Douven and Wenmackers 2017; see Climenhaga\n2017 for discussion). If it does, then following that rule\ninstead of Bayes\u2019 rule may have advantages which perhaps are not\nso readily expressed in terms of money yet which should arguably be\ntaken into account when deciding which rule to go by. It is, in short,\nnot so clear whether following a probabilistically incoherent rule\nmust be irrational. \nFor another thing, Douven (1999) argues that the question of whether a\nprobabilistic rule is coherent is not one that can be settled\nindependently of considering which other epistemic and\ndecision-theoretic rules are deployed along with it; coherence should\nbe understood as a property of packages of both epistemic and\ndecision-theoretic rules, not of epistemic rules (such as\nprobabilistic rules for belief change) in isolation. In the same\npaper, a coherent package of rules is described which includes a\nprobabilistic version of abduction. (See Kvanvig 1994, Harman 1997,\nLeplin 1997, Niiniluoto 1999, and Okasha 2000, for different responses\nto van Fraassen\u2019s critique of probabilistic versions of\nabduction.)"},"1":{"chunk_id":"69ba09533ac3ea7b6f40ae876f7a1536","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["4.

One semantically sophisticated\ndevelopment of this thought is Mandelkern et al, 2017, which proposes\nto take as basic a notion of \u2018practically available\nactions,\u2019 and to develop in terms of these a semantics for\nagentive modality, one on which conditionals linking volitions to\nactions continue to play an essential role. Another approach, in a\nrecent book-length treatment of ability (Jaster 2020), proposes that\nabilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where\nan agent successfully does what she intends to do (compare the\napproach to dispositions advocated in Manley and Wasserman 2008). Both\nof these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they\nshare \u2014 with the new dispositionalists \u2014 the thought that\nthe analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of\ndependence between volition and action. \nThis is not surprising. The conditional analysis is a redoubtable\nproposal, endorsed by many of the major figures in English-language\nphilosophy. In light of that, it seems reasonable to try to discard\nthe letter of (CA), but retain its spirit. For it may be that the\nhistorical failure of (CA) is due to difficulties and oversights that\nour perhaps firmer grasp of technical issues allows us to overcome.\nThis is a sensible and well-motivated project, though it remains to be\nseen whether it will be, in the end, a successful one. \nThere remain still other accounts that do not fit easily into the\ntaxonomy provided here. These include primitivist proposals, which\ntake ability or some closely related notion as analytically\nfundamental. One development of this idea is Maier 2015, who proposes,\ncontrary to most authors, that specific ability is fundamentally prior\nto general ability. He argues that we should give an account of\ngeneral ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls\n\u2018options\u2019: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A\niff she normally has A as an option. Options, in turn, are primitives.\nMuch here will hang on saying more about options, and in what sense\nthey figure as primitives in the theory of agency. \nFinally, an outline of a proposal by David Lewis (dated to 2001 but\nonly recently published as Lewis 2020) offers an altogether different\napproach to ability. Lewis is motivated, like many proponents of (CA),\nby the goal of defending compatibilism, but he takes (CA) to be\nunsatisfactory. He therefore proposes a non-conditional analysis of\nability. His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to\nperform an action B just in case there is some basic\naction A such that (i) S\u2019s doing A\nwould cause or constitute S\u2019s doing B and (ii)\nthere is no obstacle to S\u2019s doing A. The\nproblem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of\ngiving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his\noutline, makes a beginning. (See\u00a0Beebee et al 2020\u00a0for\nadditional discussion). \nLewis\u2019s proposal is an inspiration for further research in at\nleast two ways. First, it indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the\nproblem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding\nproject. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to\nability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of\nability may yet be in its early stages."},"4":{"chunk_id":"979ac0c826f96f3dbe19ebb628b69c21","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["5.

As a result, a priori defenses\nof abduction seem out of the question. Indeed, all defenses that have\nbeen given so far are of an empirical nature in that they appeal to\ndata that supposedly support the claim that (in some form) abduction\nis a reliable rule of inference. \nThe best-known argument of this sort was developed by Richard Boyd in\nthe 1980s (see Boyd 1981, 1984, 1985). It starts by underlining the\ntheory-dependency of scientific methodology, which comprises methods\nfor designing experiments, for assessing data, for choosing between\nrival hypotheses, and so on. For instance, in considering possible\nconfounding factors from which an experimental setup has to be\nshielded, scientists draw heavily on already accepted theories. The\nargument next calls attention to the apparent reliability of this\nmethodology, which, after all, has yielded, and continues to yield,\nimpressively accurate theories. In particular, by relying on this\nmethodology, scientists have for some time now been able to find ever\nmore instrumentally adequate theories. Boyd then argues that the\nreliability of scientific methodology is best explained by assuming\nthat the theories on which it relies are at least approximately true.\nFrom this and from the fact that these theories were mostly arrived at\nby abductive reasoning, he concludes that abduction must be a reliable\nrule of inference. \nCritics have accused this argument of being circular. Specifically, it\nhas been said that the argument rests on a premise\u2014that\nscientific methodology is informed by approximately true background\ntheories\u2014which in turn rests on an inference to the best\nexplanation for its plausibility. And the reliability of this type of\ninference is precisely what is at stake. (See, for instance, Laudan\n1981 and Fine 1984.) \nTo this, Stathis Psillos (1999, Ch. 4) has responded by invoking a\ndistinction credited to Richard Braithwaite, to wit, the distinction\nbetween premise-circularity and rule-circularity. An argument is\npremise-circular if its conclusion is amongst its premises. A\nrule-circular argument, by contrast, is an argument of which the\nconclusion asserts something about an inferential rule that is used in\nthe very same argument. As Psillos urges, Boyd\u2019s argument is\nrule-circular, but not premise-circular, and rule-circular arguments,\nPsillos contends, need not be viciously circular (even though\na premise-circular argument is always viciously circular). To be more\nprecise, in his view, an argument for the reliability of a given rule\nR that essentially relies on R as an inferential\nprinciple is not vicious, provided that the use of R does not\nguarantee a positive conclusion about R\u2019s reliability.\nPsillos claims that in Boyd\u2019s argument, this proviso is met. For\nwhile Boyd concludes that the background theories on which scientific\nmethodology relies are approximately true on the basis of an abductive\nstep, the use of abduction itself does not guarantee the truth of his\nconclusion. After all, granting the use of abduction does nothing to\nensure that the best explanation of the success of scientific\nmethodology is the approximate truth of the relevant background\ntheories. Thus, Psillos concludes, Boyd\u2019s argument still\nstands. \nEven if the use of abduction in Boyd\u2019s argument might have led\nto the conclusion that abduction is not reliable, one may\nstill have worries about the argument\u2019s being rule-circular. For\nsuppose that some scientific community relied not on abduction but on\na rule that we may dub \u201cInference to the Worst\nExplanation\u201d (IWE), a rule that sanctions inferring to the\nworst explanation of the available data. We may safely assume\nthat the use of this rule mostly would lead to the adoption of very\nunsuccessful theories. Nevertheless, the said community might justify\nits use of IWE by dint of the following reasoning: \u201cScientific\ntheories tend to be hugely unsuccessful. These theories were arrived\nat by application of IWE. That IWE is a reliable rule of\ninference\u2014that is, a rule of inference mostly leading from true\npremises to true conclusions\u2014is surely the worst explanation of\nthe fact that our theories are so unsuccessful. Hence, by application\nof IWE, we may conclude that IWE is a reliable rule of\ninference.\u201d While this would be an utterly absurd conclusion,\nthe argument leading up to it cannot be convicted of being viciously\ncircular anymore than Boyd\u2019s argument for the reliability of\nabduction can (if Psillos is right). It would appear, then, that there\nmust be something else amiss with rule-circularity. \nIt is fair to note that for Psillos, the fact that a rule-circular\nargument does not guarantee a positive conclusion about the rule at\nissue is not sufficient for such an argument to be valid. A further\nnecessary condition is \u201cthat one should not have reason to doubt\nthe reliability of the rule\u2014that there is nothing currently\navailable which can make one distrust the rule\u201d (Psillos 1999,\n85). And there is plenty of reason to doubt the reliability of IWE; in\nfact, the above argument supposes that it is unreliable. Two\nquestions arise, however. First, why should we accept the additional\ncondition? Second, do we really have no reason to doubt the\nreliability of abduction? Certainly some of the abductive\ninferences we make lead us to accept falsehoods. How many\nfalsehoods may we accept on the basis of abduction before we can\nlegitimately begin to distrust this rule? No clear answers have been\ngiven to these questions. \nBe this as it may, even if rule-circularity is neither vicious nor\notherwise problematic, one may still wonder how Boyd\u2019s argument\nis to convert a critic of abduction, given that it relies on\nabduction. But Psillos makes it clear that the point of philosophical\nargumentation is not always, and in any case need not be, to convince\nan opponent of one\u2019s position. Sometimes the point is, more\nmodestly, to assure or reassure oneself that the position one\nendorses, or is tempted to endorse, is correct. In the case at hand,\nwe need not think of Boyd\u2019s argument as an attempt to convince\nthe opponent of abduction of its reliability. Rather, it may be\nthought of as justifying the rule from within the perspective of\nsomeone who is already sympathetic towards abduction; see Psillos 1999\n(89). \nThere have also been attempts to argue for abduction in a more\nstraightforward fashion, to wit, via enumerative induction. The common\nidea of these attempts is that every newly recorded successful\napplication of abduction\u2014like the discovery of Neptune, whose\nexistence had been postulated on explanatory grounds (see Section\n1.2)\u2014adds further support to the hypothesis that abduction is a\nreliable rule of inference, in the way in which every newly observed\nblack raven adds some support to the hypothesis that all ravens are\nblack. Because it does not involve abductive reasoning, this type of\nargument is more likely to also appeal to disbelievers in abduction.\nSee Harr\u00e9 1986, 1988, Bird 1998 (160), Kitcher 2001, and Douven\n2002 for suggestions along these lines."},"1":{"chunk_id":"67b93c279b2301aacbe4d53b37eeaad9","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["4.

Perhaps the most prominent substantive role\nfor a theory of ability\u00a0has been the uses to which accounts of\nability have been put in the free will debates. So let us close with a\nbrief survey of what work a theory of ability might be expected to do\nin those debates. \nQuestions about abilities have figured most prominently in debates\nover compatibilism. \u2018Compatibilism\u2019 is used in many ways,\nbut let us understand it here as the thesis that the ability to\nperform actions one does not perform is compossible with the truth of\ndeterminism, which we may take to be the view that the facts about the\npast and the laws jointly determine the facts about the present and\nall future moments. (We should sharply distinguish this view, which we\nmight call classical compatibilism, from more recent views\nsuch as the \u2018semi-compatibilism\u2019 of Fischer and Ravizza\n1998). Insofar as compatibilism, so understood, has been explicitly\ndefended, these defenses have made appeal to theories of ability,\nnotably the conditional analysis and its variants, as well as the\ndispositionalist analysis favored by the new dispositionalists. \nIn the discussion of the conditional analysis, we distinguished\nbetween global and local counterexamples to\nhypothetical theories of ability, where the former appealed to the\nfact that any such theory would render ability compatible with\ndeterminism which, according to the objector, it is not. There we\nnoted the dialectical limitations of such counterexamples, namely the\ncontentiousness of their main premise. But compatibilists have often\nbeen guilty of what seems to be the opposite mistake. Namely, they\nhave offered theories of ability which show abilities to be compatible\nwith determinism, and have argued from this to the claim that\nsuch abilities are indeed compatible with determinism. \nThe shortcomings of this strategy are nicely diagnosed by Peter van\nInwagen. After surveying the local counterexamples that arise for\nvarious hypothetical theories of ability, van Inwagen imagines that we\nhave arrived at the best possible hypothetical theory of ability,\nwhich he labels \u2018the Analysis\u2019. van Inwagen then\nwrites: \nWhat does the Analysis do for us? How does it affect our understanding\nof the Compatibility Problem? It does very little for us, so far as I\ncan see, unless we have some reason to think it is correct.\nMany compatibilists seem to think that they need only present a\nconditional analysis of ability, defend it against, or modify it in\nthe face of, such counter-examples as may arise, and that they have\nthereby done what is necessary to defend compatibilism. That is not\nhow I see it. The particular analysis of ability that a compatibilist\npresents is, as I see it, simply one of his premisses; his central\npremiss, in fact. And premisses need to be defended. (van Inwagen\n1983, 121)\n \nvan Inwagen\u2019s point is that, provided the incompatibilist has\noffered arguments for the claim that such abilities are\nincompatible with determinism\u2014as, in van Inwagen\u2019s\npresentation, the incompatibilist has\u2014the production of an\nanalysis is as yet no answer to those arguments. For those arguments\nare also arguments, inter alia, against the\ncompatibilist\u2019s favored account of ability. \nThere are, then, several obstacles for the compatibilist who wishes to\nappeal to an account of ability in defense of compatibilism. First,\nthere is the general difficulty of actually giving an extensionally\nadequate theory of ability. In addition, we have now turned up a\ncouple of more specific challenges to the compatibilist. There is van\nInwagen\u2019s point just outlined, namely that arguments for the\nincompatibility of abilities and determinism are, inter alia,\narguments against any theory of ability that is congenial to the\ncompatibilist. And, finally, there is the point that we encountered in\nour discussion of the new dispositionalism in Section 5.1, which is\nthat certain platitudes about ability \u2014 in particular, those\ninvolved in certain judgments about moral responsibility \u2014 may\nbe recalcitrant to compatibilist treatments. Taken together, these\npoints seem to pose a serious obstacle to any theory of ability that\nis both compatible with determinism and in accord with our ordinary\njudgments about what ability requires. \nWhat is the compatibilist to say in light of these obstacles? One\nresponse is to make a distinction between two kinds of compatibilist\nproject. (Compare Pryor 2000 on responses to skepticism). One project\nis to convince someone moved by the incompatibilist\u2019s\narguments to retreat from her position. Call this ambitious\ncompatibilism. For precisely the reasons van Inwagen gives, it is\ndoubtful that any theory of ability will suffice for a defense of\nambitious compatibilism. There is another project, however, that the\ncompatibilist might be engaging in. Let us say that, for some reason\nor other, she herself is not convinced by the incompatibilist\u2019s\nargument. She is still left with an explanatory burden, namely to\nexplain, if only to her own satisfaction, how it could\nbe that abilities are compatible with the truth of determinism.\nHere the compatibilist\u2019s aim is not to convince the\nincompatibilist of the error of her ways, but simply to work out a\nsatisfactory conception of compatibilism. Let us call this\nmodest compatibilism. This distinction is not often made, and\nit is not always clear which of these projects classical\ncompatibilists are engaged in. If the latter project is indeed part of\nclassical compatibilism, then we may grant many of the above points\nwhile still granting the theory of ability a central place in defenses\nof compatibilism. For it may be that, though a theory of ability is of\nno use to the ambitious compatibilist, it has a crucial role to play\nin the defense of modest compatibilism. \nEven these compatibilist aspirations, however, may be overly\noptimistic, or at least premature. For in surveying theories of\nability we have turned up serious difficulties, for both hypothetical\nand non-hypothetical approaches, which do not appear to turn on issues\nabout determinism. So it may be that the best hope for progress is to\npursue theories of ability while setting to one side the problems\nraised in the free will debates. For given the difficulties posed by\nabilities, and given the significance of theories of ability for areas\nof philosophy quite removed from the free will debates, there is\nsomething to be said for pursuing a theory of ability while embracing,\nif only temporarily, a certain quietism about the puzzles that\ndeterminism may pose."},"4":{"chunk_id":"da2bfb4c31a321a202c3ff0e6ada4844","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["5.

Abduction, in whichever\nversion, assigns a confirmation-theoretic role to explanation:\nexplanatory considerations contribute to making some hypotheses more\ncredible, and others less so. By contrast, Bayesian confirmation\ntheory makes no reference at all to the concept of explanation. Does\nthis imply that abduction is at loggerheads with the prevailing\ndoctrine in confirmation theory? Several authors have recently argued\nthat not only is abduction compatible with Bayesianism, it is a\nmuch-needed supplement to it. The so far fullest defense of this view\nhas been given by Lipton (2004, Ch. 7); as he puts it, Bayesians\nshould also be \u201cexplanationists\u201d (his name for the\nadvocates of abduction). (For other defenses, see Okasha 2000, McGrew\n2003, Weisberg 2009, and Poston 2014, Ch. 7; for discussion, see Roche\nand Sober 2013, 2014, and McCain and Poston 2014.) \nThis requires some clarification. For what could it mean for a\nBayesian to be an explanationist? In order to apply Bayes\u2019 rule\nand determine the probability for H after learning E,\nthe Bayesian agent will have to determine the probability of H\nconditional on E. For that, he needs to assign unconditional\nprobabilities to H and E as well as a probability to\nE given H; the former two are mostly called \u201cprior\nprobabilities\u201d (or just \u201cpriors\u201d) of, respectively,\nH and E, the latter the \u201clikelihood\u201d of\nH on E. (This is the official Bayesian story. Not all of\nthose who sympathize with Bayesianism adhere to that story. For\ninstance, according to some it is more reasonable to think that\nconditional probabilities are basic and that we derive unconditional\nprobabilities from them; see H\u00e1jek 2003, and references\ntherein.) How is the Bayesian to determine these values? As is well\nknown, probability theory gives us more probabilities once we have\nsome; it does not give us probabilities from scratch. Of course, when\nH implies E or the negation of E, or when\nH is a statistical hypothesis that bestows a certain chance on\nE, then the likelihood follows \u201canalytically.\u201d\n(This claim assumes some version of Lewis\u2019 (1980) Principal\nPrinciple, and it is controversial whether or not this principle is\nanalytic; hence the scare quotes.) But this is not always the case,\nand even if it were, there would still be the question of how to\ndetermine the priors. This is where, according to Lipton, abduction\ncomes in. In his proposal, Bayesians ought to determine their prior\nprobabilities and, if applicable, likelihoods on the basis of\nexplanatory considerations. \nExactly how are explanatory considerations to guide one\u2019s choice\nof priors? The answer to this question is not as simple as one might\nat first think. Suppose you are considering what priors to assign to a\ncollection of rival hypotheses and you wish to follow Lipton\u2019s\nsuggestion. How are you to do this? An obvious\u2014though still\nsomewhat vague\u2014answer may seem to go like this: Whatever exact\npriors you are going to assign, you should assign a higher one to the\nhypothesis that explains the available data best than to any of its\nrivals (provided there is a best explanation). Note, though, that your\nneighbor, who is a Bayesian but thinks confirmation has nothing to do\nwith explanation, may well assign a prior to the best explanation that\nis even higher than the one you assign to that hypothesis. In fact,\nhis priors for best explanations may even be consistently higher than\nyours, not because in his view explanation is somehow related to\nconfirmation\u2014it is not, he thinks\u2014but, well, just because.\nIn this context, \u201cjust because\u201d is a perfectly legitimate\nreason, because any reason for fixing one\u2019s priors counts as\nlegitimate by Bayesian standards. According to mainstream Bayesian\nepistemology, priors (and sometimes likelihoods) are up for grabs,\nmeaning that one assignment of priors is as good as another, provided\nboth are coherent (that is, they obey the axioms of probability\ntheory). Lipton\u2019s recommendation to the Bayesian to be an\nexplanationist is meant to be entirely general. But what should your\nneighbor do differently if he wants to follow the recommendation?\nShould he give the same prior to any best explanation that you, his\nexplanationist neighbor, give to it, that is, lower his\npriors for best explanations? Or rather should he give even\nhigher priors to best explanations than those he already\ngives? \nPerhaps Lipton\u2019s proposal is not intended to address those who\nalready assign highest priors to best explanations, even if they do so\non grounds that have nothing to do with explanation. The idea might be\nthat, as long as one does assign highest priors to those hypotheses,\neverything is fine, or at least finer than if one does not do so,\nregardless of one\u2019s reasons for assigning those priors. The\nanswer to the question of how explanatory considerations are to guide\none\u2019s choice of priors would then presumably be that one ought\nto assign a higher prior to the best explanation than to its rivals,\nif this is not what one already does. If it is, one should just keep\ndoing what one is doing. \n(As an aside, it should be noticed that, according to standard\nBayesian usage, the term \u201cpriors\u201d does not necessarily\nrefer to the degrees of belief a person assigns before the receipt of\nany data. If there are already data in, then, clearly, one\nmay assign higher priors to hypotheses that best explain the\nthen-available data. However, one can sensibly speak of \u201cbest\nexplanations\u201d even before any data are known. For example, one\nhypothesis may be judged to be a better explanation than any of its\nrivals because the former requires less complicated mathematics, or\nbecause it is stated in terms of familiar concepts only, which is not\ntrue of the others. More generally, such judgments may be based on\nwhat Kosso (1992, 30) calls internal features of hypotheses\nor theories, that is, features that \u201ccan be evaluated without\nhaving to observe the world.\u201d) \nA more interesting answer to the above question of how explanation is\nto guide one\u2019s choice of priors has been given by Jonathan\nWeisberg (2009). We said that mainstream Bayesians regard one\nassignment of prior probabilities as being as good as any other.\nSo-called objective Bayesians do not do so, however. These Bayesians\nthink priors must obey principles beyond the probability axioms in\norder to be admissible. Objective Bayesians are divided among\nthemselves over exactly which further principles are to be obeyed, but\nat least for a while they agreed that the Principle of Indifference is\namong them. Roughly stated, this principle counsels that, absent a\nreason to the contrary, we give equal priors to competing hypotheses.\nAs is well known, however, in its original form the Principle of\nIndifference may lead to inconsistent assignments of probabilities and\nso can hardly be advertised as a principle of rationality. The problem\nis that there are typically various ways to partition logical space\nthat appear plausible given the problem at hand, and that not all of\nthem lead to the same prior probability assignment, even assuming the\nPrinciple of Indifference. Weisberg\u2019s proposal amounts to the\nclaim that explanatory considerations may favor some of those\npartitions over others. Perhaps we will not always end up with a\nunique partition to which the Principle of Indifference is to be\napplied, but it would already be progress if we ended up with only a\nhandful of partitions. For we could then still arrive in a motivated\nway at our prior probabilities, by proceeding in two steps, namely, by\nfirst applying the Principle of Indifference to the partitions\nseparately, thereby possibly obtaining different assignments of\npriors, and by then taking a weighted average of the thus obtained\npriors, where the weights, too, are to depend on explanatory\nconsiderations. The result would again be a probability\nfunction\u2014the uniquely correct prior probability function,\naccording to Weisberg. \nThe proposal is intriguing as far as it goes but, as Weisberg admits,\nin its current form, it does not go very far. For one thing, it is\nunclear how exactly explanatory considerations are to determine the\nweights required for the second step of the proposal. For another, it\nmay be idle to hope that taking explanatory considerations into\naccount will in general leave us with a manageable set of partitions,\nor that, even if it does, this will not be due merely to the fact that\nwe are overlooking a great many prima facie plausible ways of\npartitioning logical space to begin with. (The latter point echoes the\nargument of the bad lot, of course.) \nAnother suggestion about the connection between abduction and Bayesian\nreasoning\u2014to be found in Okasha 2000, McGrew 2003, Lipton 2004\n(Ch. 7), and Dells\u00e9n 2018\u2014is that the explanatory\nconsiderations may serve as a heuristic to determine, even if only\nroughly, priors and likelihoods in cases in which we would otherwise\nbe clueless and could do no better than guessing. This suggestion is\nsensitive to the well-recognized fact that we are not always able to\nassign a prior to every hypothesis of interest, or to say how probable\na given piece of evidence is conditional on a given hypothesis.\nConsideration of that hypothesis\u2019 explanatory power might then\nhelp us to figure out, if perhaps only within certain bounds, what\nprior to assign to it, or what likelihood to assign to it on the given\nevidence. \nBayesians, especially the more modest ones, might want to retort that\nthe Bayesian procedure is to be followed if, and only if, either (a)\npriors and likelihoods can be determined with some precision and\nobjectivity, or (b) likelihoods can be determined with some precision\nand priors can be expected to \u201cwash out\u201d as more and more\nevidence accumulates, or (c) priors and likelihoods can both be\nexpected to wash out. In the remaining cases\u2014they might\nsay\u2014we should simply refrain from applying Bayesian reasoning. A\nfortiori, then, there is no need for an abduction-enhanced Bayesianism\nin these cases. And some incontrovertible mathematical results\nindicate that, in the cases that fall under (a), (b), or (c), our\nprobabilities will converge to the truth anyhow. Consequently, in\nthose cases there is no need for the kind of abductive heuristics that\nthe above-mentioned authors suggest, either. (Weisberg 2009, Sect.\n3.2, raises similar concerns.) \nPsillos (2000) proposes yet another way in which abduction might\nsupplement Bayesian confirmation theory, one that is very much in the\nspirit of Peirce\u2019s conception of abduction. The idea is that\nabduction may assist us in selecting plausible candidates for testing,\nwhere the actual testing then is to follow Bayesian lines. However,\nPsillos concedes (2004) that this proposal assigns a role to abduction\nthat will strike committed explanationists as being too limited. \nFinally, a possibility that has so far not been considered in the\nliterature is that abduction and Bayesianism do not so much work in\ntandem\u2014as they do on the above proposals\u2014as operate in\ndifferent modes of reasoning; the Bayesian and the explanationist are\ncharacters that feature in different plays, so to speak. It is widely\naccepted that sometimes we speak and think about our beliefs in a\ncategorical manner, while at other times we speak and think about them\nin a graded way. It is far from clear how these different ways of\nspeaking and thinking about beliefs\u2014the epistemology of belief\nand the epistemology of degrees of belief, to use Richard\nFoley\u2019s (1992) terminology\u2014are related to one another. In\nfact, it is an open question whether there is any straightforward\nconnection between the two, or even whether there is a connection at\nall. Be that as it may, given that the distinction is undeniable, it\nis a plausible suggestion that, just as there are different ways of\ntalking and thinking about beliefs, there are different ways of\ntalking and thinking about the revision of beliefs. In\nparticular, abduction could well have its home in the epistemology of\nbelief, and be called upon whenever we reason about our beliefs in a\ncategorical mode, while at the same time Bayes\u2019 rule could have\nits home in the epistemology of degrees of belief. Hard-nosed\nBayesians may insist that whatever reasoning goes on in the\ncategorical mode must eventually be justifiable in Bayesian terms, but\nthis presupposes the existence of bridge principles connecting the\nepistemology of belief with the epistemology of degrees of\nbelief\u2014and, as mentioned, whether such principles exist is\npresently unclear."},"1":{"chunk_id":"0c4e9c4c4c155de1b1cb270e46329e87","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["4.

Nevertheless, the\nobject of the doctrine of momentariness is not so much existence in\ntime or the passage of time per se, but rather, in epistemological\nterms and a somewhat Bergsonian sense, the construction of temporal\nexperience. Instead of a transcendental matrix of order imposed on\nnatural events from without, time is seen as an inherent feature of\nthe operation of dharmas. The doctrine of momentariness\nanalyzes dharmas as they transpire through time: as\npsycho-physical events that arise and cease in consciousness and, by\nthe dynamics of their rise and fall, construct time. The sequence of\nthe three times is therefore secondary, generated in and by the\nprocess of conditioned and conditioning dharmas. In fact, the\nconceptual shift from the principle of impermanence to the theory of\nmomentariness is a shift in time scales. While the S\u016btr\u0101nta\nworldview interprets the three times as referring to past, present,\nand future lives, the Abhidharma sees them as phases that any\nconditioned dharma undergoes each and every moment.\nImpermanence marks dharmas over a period of time, but is also\nencapsulated in every single consciousness moment (Vibh-a\n7\u20138; Sv 991; Vism XIV 191; Collins 1992, 227)."},"3":{"chunk_id":"3810ea0e030c194a7c672895bb7bc60e","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["6.

At\nthe heart of these interpretations is the concept of intrinsic nature\n(Skt., svabh\u0101va, Pali, sabh\u0101va) that plays\na major role in the systematization of Abhidharma thought, is closely\nrelated to the consolidation of the dharma theory, and is\nregarded as that which gave an impetus to the Abhidharma growing\nconcern with ontology. \nThe term svabh\u0101va\/sabh\u0101va does not feature in the\ns\u016btras\/suttas and its rare mentions in other\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da canonical texts offer no\naccount of dharma as defined by a fixed intrinsic nature that\nverifies its real\n existence.[11]\n This situation changes significantly in the post-canonical\nliterature, in which svabh\u0101va becomes a standard concept\nextensively used in dharma exegesis. A recurring idea in the\nexegetical Abhidharma literature from the period of the early\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward is that\ndharmas are defined by virtue of their\nsvabh\u0101va. For instance, a definition transmitted in the\nAbhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya reads:\n\u201cdharma means \u2018upholding,\u2019 [namely],\nupholding intrinsic nature (svabh\u0101va),\u201d and the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 states that \u201cintrinsic\nnature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it [\u2026]\nas in the case of unconditioned dharmas that are able to\nuphold their own identity\u201d (Cox 2004A, 558\u2013559).\nSimilarly, a definition prevalent in Therav\u0101din Abhidhamma\ncommentaries is: \u201cdhammas are so called because they\nbear their intrinsic natures, or because they are borne by causal\nconditions\u201d (e.g., Dhs-a 39-40; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 18; Vism-mh\u1e6d I 347). The commentaries also regularly\nequate dhammas with their intrinsic natures, using the terms\ndhamma and sabh\u0101va interchangeably. For\nexample, the Visuddhimagga proclaims that\n\u201cdhamma means but intrinsic nature\u201d\n(Vism VIII 246), and the sub-commentary to the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i indicates that \u201cthere is no\nother thing called dhamma apart from the intrinsic nature\nborne by it\u201d and that \u201cthe term sabh\u0101va\ndenotes the mere fact of being a dhamma\u201d\n(Dhs-m\u1e6d 28 & 94; see also Karunadasa 2010: Ch.\n1). \nThese commentarial definitions of dharmas as carrying their\nintrinsic natures should not be interpreted ontologically as implying\nthat dharmas are substances having inherent existence. The\nPali commentaries, cautions Gethin (2004, 533), \u201care often\nviewed too much in the light of later controversies about the precise\nontological status of dharmas and the Madhyamaka critique of\nthe notion of svabh\u0101va in the sense of \u2018inherent\nexistence.\u2019\u201d In fact, defining dharmas as bearing\ntheir intrinsic natures conveys the idea that there is no enduring\nagent behind them. Adding that dharmas are borne by causal\nconditions counters the idea of intrinsic natures borne by underlying\nsubstances distinct from themselves. Just as dharmas are\npsycho-physical events that occur dependently on appropriate\nconditions and qualities, their intrinsic natures arise dependently on\nother conditions and qualities rather than on a substratum more real\nthan they are (ibid; Karunadasa 1996, 13\u201316;\nNyanaponika 1998, 40\u201341). \nWe must also note that the context within which dharmas are\nrendered in terms of their intrinsic natures is that of\ncategorization, where multiple criteria and qualities are applied to\ncreate a comprehensive taxonomic system that distinguishes the\nparticular character of any given dharma. Cox (2004A:\n559\u2013561) has shown that in the early period of northern Indian\nAbhidharma texts, as represented by the\n\u015a\u0101riputr\u0101bhidharma\u015b\u0101stra and\nportions of the Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, the concept\nof intrinsic nature develops within the context of the method of\ninclusion (sa\u1e43graha), that is, the process by which the\ninclusion of dharmas within a specific category is to be\napplied. Dharmas are determined (parini\u1e63panna)\nby the intrinsic nature that defines them and hence should not be\nconsidered to possess a separately existing intrinsic nature.\n\u201c\u2018Determination\u2019 implies two further features of\ndharmas [\u2026] First, just as categories in a\nwell-structured taxonomic schema are distinct and not subject to\nfluctuation, so also dharmas, as \u2018determined,\u2019\nare clearly and unalterably discriminated: they are uniquely\nindividualized and as such are not subject to confusion with other\ndharmas. [Second,] determination by intrinsic nature\nundergoes no variation or modification, and hence, dharmas,\nwhich are in effect types or categories of intrinsic nature, are\nestablished as stable and immutable\u201d (ibid, 562). In\nthe early Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegetical texts, then,\nsvabh\u0101va is used as an atemporal, invariable criterion\ndetermining what a dharma is, not necessarily\nthat a dharma exists. The concern here is primarily\nwith what makes categorial types of dharma unique, rather\nthan with the ontological status of dharmas. \nNevertheless, from the foregoing categorial theory, the mature\nAbhidharma drew ontological conclusions with regard to the reality of\ndharmas. This transition in the conception of dharma\ncoincided with an inherent ambiguity in the term\nsvabh\u0101va, which is grounded logically and etymologically\nin the term bh\u0101va that came to denote \u201cmode of\nexistence\u201d (ibid, 565\u2013568). In the\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia and contemporaneous texts,\n\u201cthe explicit emphasis upon categorization per se\nrecedes in importance as the focus shifts to clarifying the character\nand eventually the ontological status of individual dharmas.\nAccordingly, the term svabh\u0101va acquires the dominant\nsense of \u2018intrinsic nature\u2019 specifying individual\ndharmas [\u2026] And determining individual\ndharmas through unique intrinsic nature also entails\naffirming their existence, as a natural function both of the\netymological sense of the term svabh\u0101va and of the role\nof dharmas as the fundamental constituents of experience.\nThis then leads to the prominence of a new term that expressed this\nontological focus: namely, dravya\u201d (ibid,\n569). Dravya means \u201creal existence\u201d and, within\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, dharmas that are\ndetermined by intrinsic nature exist as real entities\n(dravyatas), as opposed both to composite objects of ordinary\nexperience that exist provisionally and to relative concepts or\ncontingencies of time and place that exist relatively. The presence of\nintrinsic nature indicates that a dharma is a primary\nexistent, irrespective of its temporal status, namely, whether it is a\npast, present or future dharma, and hence the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da declaration that \u201call things\nexist.\u201d \nThe Therav\u0101da rejected the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological\nmodel, claiming that dhammas exist only in the present. But\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma shares with the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nthe same principles of dhamma analysis as a categorial theory\nthat individuates sentient experience. Here, too, the taxonomic\nfunction of sabh\u0101va gave rise to ontological\nconnotations of existence in the characterization of dhammas.\nAs the final units of Abhidhamma analysis, dhammas are\nreckoned the ultimate constituents of experience. \u201cThere is\nnothing else, whether a being, or an entity, or a man or a\nperson,\u201d a famous Pali commentarial excerpt proclaims\n(Dhs-a\n 155).[12]\n While this statement is meant to refute the rival Pudgalav\u0101da\nposition of the reality of the person by insisting that there is no\nbeing or person apart from dhammas, there emerges the idea\nthat the phenomenal world is, at bottom, a world of dhammas:\nthat within the confines of sentient experience there is no other\nactuality apart from dhammas and that what constitutes any\ngiven dhamma as a discrete, individualized particular is its\nintrinsic nature. The Therav\u0101da elaborates on the concept of\nsabh\u0101va in juxtaposition to its theory of momentariness,\nand it acquires the sense of what underlies a dhamma\u2019s\nendurance moment and as a point of reference to the moments of\norigination and cessation. Before a dhamma eventuates it does\nnot yet obtain an intrinsic nature and when it ceases it is denuded of\nthis intrinsic nature. As a present occurrence, though, while\npossessing its intrinsic nature, it exists as an ultimate reality and\nits intrinsic nature is evidence of its actual existence as such\n(Dhs-a 45; Vism VIII 234, XV 15). One commentarial\npassage even goes so far as naming this instant \u201cthe acquisition\nof a self\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d I 343)."},"3":{"chunk_id":"d1229e80b42107614e59d4a0ba2b65ec","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["6.

For\ninstance, according to some it is more reasonable to think that\nconditional probabilities are basic and that we derive unconditional\nprobabilities from them; see H\u00e1jek 2003, and references\ntherein.) How is the Bayesian to determine these values? As is well\nknown, probability theory gives us more probabilities once we have\nsome; it does not give us probabilities from scratch. Of course, when\nH implies E or the negation of E, or when\nH is a statistical hypothesis that bestows a certain chance on\nE, then the likelihood follows \u201canalytically.\u201d\n(This claim assumes some version of Lewis\u2019 (1980) Principal\nPrinciple, and it is controversial whether or not this principle is\nanalytic; hence the scare quotes.) But this is not always the case,\nand even if it were, there would still be the question of how to\ndetermine the priors. This is where, according to Lipton, abduction\ncomes in. In his proposal, Bayesians ought to determine their prior\nprobabilities and, if applicable, likelihoods on the basis of\nexplanatory considerations."},"1":{"chunk_id":"1d4a8de50ff5f790bd6b336ee76490fe","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["4.

A recurring idea in the\nexegetical Abhidharma literature from the period of the early\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward is that\ndharmas are defined by virtue of their\nsvabh\u0101va.

The commentaries also regularly\nequate dhammas with their intrinsic natures, using the terms\ndhamma and sabh\u0101va interchangeably. For\nexample, the Visuddhimagga proclaims that\n\u201cdhamma means but intrinsic nature\u201d\n(Vism VIII 246), and the sub-commentary to the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i indicates that \u201cthere is no\nother thing called dhamma apart from the intrinsic nature\nborne by it\u201d and that \u201cthe term sabh\u0101va\ndenotes the mere fact of being a dhamma\u201d\n(Dhs-m\u1e6d 28 & 94; see also Karunadasa 2010: Ch.\n1)."},"3":{"chunk_id":"a8d5f090499aff1429082cda52128241","article_title":"Abilities","section_path":["6.

One primary controversy centered on the\nprinciple of impermanence: if all phenomena are impermanent, the\nSautr\u0101ntika challenged the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the\nTherav\u0101da, then dharmas must be changing continuously\nand can neither exist in the past and future nor endure for any period\nof time, however short, in the present. On the other hand, the\nsystematic analysis of experience in terms of momentary\ndharmas required the Abhidharma to provide a rigorous account\nof the processes that govern psychological and physical continuity.\nWhat fuels these processes is causal interaction, but the very notion\nof causation is allegedly compromised by the theory of momentariness.\nIf causes, conditions, and their results are all momentary events, how\ncan an event that has ended have a result? How can an event that\nundergoes distinct stages of origination, endurance, and cessation in\na brief moment have causal efficacy? Notwithstanding their doctrinal\ndifferences, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the Therav\u0101da\nAbhidhamma had to confront these challenges, and they did so by\nformulating complex theories of immediate contiguity that grant causal\nefficacy. \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da developed an analysis of causal\nconditioning in terms of intricate interrelations among four types of\ncondition (pratyaya) and six types of cause (hetu).\nAs documented in the Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya\n(AKB 2.49) based on canonical texts including the\nVij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya, the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da, and the\nJ\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na, the four conditions are: 1)\nroot cause (literally \u201ccause as condition,\u201d\nhetupratyaya), reckoned the foremost in inciting the process\nof fruition and origination; 2) immediate antecedent, which holds\nbetween a consciousness moment and its immediately preceding moment in\nthat consciousness series; 3) object support, which applies to all\ndharmas insofar as they are intentional objects of\nconsciousness; and 4) predominance, which facilitates sensory\ndiscriminative awareness, e.g., the faculty of sight\u2019s\npredominance over visual cognitive awareness. The six causes are: 1)\ninstrumentality (k\u0101ra\u1e47ahetu), deemed the primary\nfactor in the production of a result; 2) simultaneity or coexistence,\nwhich connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity,\nexplaining the homogenous flow of dharmas that evokes the\nseeming continuity of phenomena; 4) association, which operates only\nbetween mental dharmas and explains why the elements of\nconsciousness always appear as assemblages of mental factors; 5)\ndominance, which forms one\u2019s habitual cognitive and behaviorist\ndispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the result of\nactively wholesome or unwholesome dharmas. The four\nconditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining\nphenomenal experience: for instance, each consciousness moment acts\nboth as the homogenous cause as well as the immediate antecedent\ncondition of the rise of consciousness and its concomitants in a\nsubsequent\n moment.[13] \nUnderlying this analysis of causal conditioning is the notion of\nexistence as efficacious action, or karma. Karma, a fundamental\nprinciple in Buddhist thought from its inception, is what fuels the\nrepetitive experience in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the round of\n rebirth.[14]\n In Abhidharma exegesis, the efficacious action or distinctive\nfunctioning of dharmas is understood predominantly as causal\nfunctioning. For the orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, the existence of\ndharmas as real entities (dravyatas) is determined\nby both their intrinsic nature and particular causal functioning.\nIntrinsic nature, however, is an atemporal determinant of real\nexistence. What determines a dharma\u2019s spatio-temporal\nexistence is its distinctive causal functioning: past and future\ndharmas have capability (s\u0101marthya) of\nfunctioning, while present dharmas also exert a distinctive\nactivity (k\u0101ritra). Present activity is an internal\ncausal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a\ndharma\u2019s own consciousness series. It is this activity\nthat determines a dharma\u2019s present existence and\ndefines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by\ncontrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards\nanother consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists\nanother dharma in the production of its own effect (Cox\n2004A, 570\u2013573; Williams 1981, 240\u2013243). A\ndharma\u2019s present activity arises and falls away, but\npast and future dharmas all have potential for causal\nfunctioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature.\nFor the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, this model\u2014which insists on\nconstant change within the limits of the present moment and implies\nthe existence of dharmas in the three time\nperiods\u2014preserves both the principle of impermanence yet\nexplains continuity and causal efficacy. \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika distinction between a\ndharma\u2019s activity and capability implies that each\ndharma or consciousness moment effects the next moment within\nits series, but it can also act as a contributory condition towards\nproducing a different sort of effect. Activity engenders the next\nmoment within a dharma\u2019s series, while capability\ngenerates a different effect and explains the causal efficacy of past\ndharmas. Williams (1981, 246\u2013247) helpfully notes that\nwe may render this \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d\ncausality, within a consciousness series and transcending it\nrespectively. For example, an instant of visual awareness horizontally\nproduces the next moment of visual awareness and may or may not,\ndepending on other factors such as light and so on, vertically produce\nvision of the object. \u201cIt follows that to be present is to have\nhorizontal causality, which may or may not include vertical\ncausality\u2014a fact which serves to remind us that we are dealing\nhere with primary existents which are frequently positioned within the\nsystem in terms of what they do\u201d (ibid). Thus activity\nor horizontal causality\u2014a dharma\u2019s function of\nprecipitating the next moment of its own consciousness\nseries\u2014individuates that dharma as a particular event\nof its kind. A dharma\u2019s capability or vertical\ncausality, by which it facilitates the occurrence of other\ndharmas outside its consciousness series, locates it within\nthe web of interrelations that connects it with the incessant rise and\nfall of other dharmas, and hence further individuates it as\nthat very particular dharma by manifesting its unique quality\nand intensity of operation. \nThe Satur\u0101ntika and the Therav\u0101da developed alternative\ntheories of causal conditioning in conjunction with their rejection of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological model and their claim that\ndharmas exist only in the present. The Sautr\u0101ntika\nexplained causal interaction among past and future dharmas by\nreference to the idea of \u201cseeds\u201d (b\u012bja), or\nmodifications in subsequent dharma series. The\nSautr\u0101ntika theory of seeds is the precursor of two extremely\nimportant concepts of later Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist thought,\nnamely, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s concepts of \u201cstore\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) and of\nBuddha-nature (tath\u0101gatagarbha) (Cox 1995, 94\u201395; Gethin\n1998, 222). The Therav\u0101da theory of causal conditioning, as set\nout in the Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na, proposes a set of\ntwenty-four conditional relations (paccaya) that account for\nall possible ways in which a phenomenon may function in conditioning\nthe rise of another phenomenon. The twenty-four conditional relations\nare: 1) root cause (hetupaccaya); 2) object support; 3)\npredominance; 4) proximity; 5) contiguity; 6) simultaneity; 7)\nreciprocity; 8) support; 9) decisive support; 10) pre-existence 11)\npost-existence; 12) habitual cultivation; 13) karma; 14) fruition; 15)\nnutriment; 16) controlling faculty; 17) jh\u0101na \u2013 a\nrelation specific to meditation attainments; 18) path \u2013 a\nrelation specific to the stages on the Buddhist path; 19) association;\n20) dissociation; 21) presence; 22) absence; 23) disappearance; 24)\n non-disappearance.[15]\n The majority of the Therav\u0101da twenty-four conditions have\ncounterparts in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da theory and both systems\nshow various other parallel interests and points of resemblance. The\nlikelihood, then, is that the two systems originated before the two\nschools separated and continued to evolve after their separation\n(Conze 1962, 152\u2013153; Kalupahana 1961, 173). \nTheir differences notwithstanding, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and\nthe Therav\u0101da theories of causal conditioning are based on the\nnotions that dharmas are psycho-physical events that perform\nspecific functions, and that to define what a dhamma is\nrequires one to determine what it does (Gethin 1992A, 150). It turns\nout, then, that the relative positioning of each dharma\nwithin a network of causes and conditions is, first and foremost, a\nmeans for its individuation. Only in a subsidiary sense is this\nnetwork an analysis of causal efficacy. What reappears here is the\ncategorial dimension of the dharma analysis qua a\nmetaphysical theory of mental events in terms of sameness of\nconditional relations. Analogous to the space-time coordinate system\nthat enables one to identify and describe material objects, the\nnetwork of conditional relations may be seen as a coordinate system\nthat locates within it any given dharma, implying that to be\na dharma is to be an event that has a place in that web of\nrelations\u2014an idea reminiscent of Donald Davidson\u2019s\nprinciple of sameness of causes and effects as a condition of identity\nof events (2001 119\u2013120 & 154\u2013161). Two\ndharma instances of the same type would fit into the web of\ncausal conditions in exactly the same way, but would then be\ndistinguished as individual instances on the grounds of their unique\ndegrees and modes of causal efficacy."},"3":null,"4":{"chunk_id":"67062b59e38a4c9511dd9af1eed90993","article_title":"Abner of Burgos","section_path":["6.

He gives a contextual explication of intentionality that\nrelies on a linguistic account of mental representation, adopting a\nprinciple of compositionality for understandings. \nThe first Aristotelian analysis takes understanding to be the\nmind\u2019s acquisition of the form of the object that is understood,\nwithout its matter. For an understanding to be about some\nthing\u2014say, a cat\u2014is for the form of the cat to be in the\nmind or intellective soul. The inherence of the form in matter makes\nthe matter to be a thing of a certain kind, so that the inherence of\nthe form cat in matter produces an actual cat, whereas the\n(immaterial) inherence of the form cat in the mind transforms\nthe mind into an understanding of a cat: the mind becomes (formally)\nidentical with its object. Since the \u2018aboutness\u2019 of\nunderstanding is analyzed as the commonness or identity of form in the\nunderstanding and the thing understood, we may call this approach the\nconformality theory of understanding. This theory captures\nthe intuition that understanding somehow inherits or includes\nproperties of what is understood, by reducing the intentionality of\nunderstanding to the objective identity of the form in the mind and\nthe form in the world. \nThe second Aristotelian analysis takes understanding to be the\nmind\u2019s possession of a concept that is a natural likeness of, or\nnaturally similar to, that of which it is a concept. For an\nunderstanding to be about some thing, such as a cat, is for there to\nbe an occurrent concept in the mind that is a natural likeness of a\ncat. The motivation for calling the likeness \u201cnatural\u201d is\nto guarantee that the resemblance between the understanding and what\nis understood is objective, and that all persons have access to the\nsame stock of concepts. (The conformality theory does this by\npostulating the objective existence of forms in things and by an\nidentical process in all persons of assimilating or acquiring forms.)\nWe may call this approach the resemblance theory of\nunderstanding: mental acts are classified according to the distinct\ndegree and kind of resemblance they have to the things that are\nunderstood. \nThe resemblance theory faces well-known problems in spelling out the\ncontent of resemblance or likeness. For example, a concept is clearly\nimmaterial, and as such radically differs from any material object.\nFurthermore, there seems to be no formal characteristic of a mental\nact in virtue of which it can non-trivially be said to resemble\nanything else. To get around these difficulties, mediaeval\nphilosophers, like the British Empiricists centuries later, appealed\nto a particular kind of resemblance, namely pictorial resemblance. A\nportrait of Socrates is about Socrates in virtue of visually\nresembling Socrates in the right ways. And just as there are pictorial\nimages that are about their subjects, so too are there mental images\nthat are about things. These mental images, whether they are concepts\nor are contained in concepts, explain the way in which a concept is\n\u2018about\u2019 an object. For an understanding to be about a cat\nis for it to be or contain a mental image of a cat. The phenomenon of\nmental \u2018aboutness\u2019 is explicated by the more familiar case\nof pictorial aboutness, itself reduced to a real relation of\nresemblance. \nDespite their common Aristotelian heritage, the conformality theory\nand the resemblance theory are not equivalent. The transformation of\nthe mind through the inherence of a form is not necessarily the same\nas the mind\u2019s possession of a concept. Equally, natural likeness\nor resemblance need not be understood as identity of form; formal\nidentity need not entail genuine resemblance, due to the different\nsubjects in which the form is embodied. \nThe standard way to reconcile the conformality theory and the\nresemblance theory is to take the mind\u2019s possession of a concept\nto be its ability to transform itself through the inherence of a form,\nconstruing formal identity as natural likeness, where having a form in\nthe mind that is identical to the form of the object understood just\nis to have a mental image of that very object. \nAbelard argues against conformality as follows. Consider a tower,\nwhich is a material object with a certain length, depth, and height;\nassume that these features compose its form, much as the shape of a\nstatue is its form. According to Aristotelian metaphysics, the\ninherence of a form in a subject makes the subject into something\ncharacterized by that form, as for instance whiteness inhering in\nSocrates makes him something white. The forms of the tower likewise\nmake that in which they inhere to be tall, wide, massive\u2014all\nphysical properties. If these forms inhere in the mind, then, they\nshould make the mind tall, wide, and massive, an absurd conclusion:\nthe mind \u201ccannot extend itself in length or width.\u201d Yet it\nis a cardinal thesis of the conformality theory that the mind has the\nidentical form that is possessed by the external object, the tower,\nalthough the form of (say) length is by its very nature physical.\nThus, Abelard concludes, conformality is incoherent. \nAbelard\u2019s main objection to the resemblance theory is that\nmental images qua images, like any sign, are inert: they\nrequire interpretation. A sign is just an object. It may be taken in a\nsignificative role, though it need not be. Abelard notes that this\ndistinction holds equally for non-mental signs: we can treat a statue\nas a lump of bronze or as a likeness. Mental images are likewise\ninert. For a sign to function significatively, then, something more is\nrequired beyond its mere presence or existence. But the resemblance\ntheory doesn\u2019t recognize the need to interpret the mental image\nas an image, and thereby mistakenly identifies understanding with the\nmere presence of a mental image in the mind. Abelard concludes that\nmental images have only an instrumental role in thought, describing\nthem as \u201cintermediary signs of things\u201d (intersigna\nrerum). Intentionality derives instead from the act of attention\n(attentio) directed upon the mental image. Proof is found in\nthe fact that that we can \u201cvary the understanding\u201d simply\nby attending to different features of the mental image: the selfsame\nimage\u2014say, a fig tree\u2014can be used to think about this very\nfig tree, or trees in general, or plant life, or my lost love with\nwhom I sat under it, or anything whatsoever. There is no intrinsic\nfeature of the mental image in virtue of which it is about any given\nthing; if there were, Abelard notes, we could determine by inspection\nwhat a sign is about\u2014but we can\u2019t. Mental images,\ntherefore, can\u2019t explain the intentionality of understanding,\nbecause their role is merely instrumental. We think with them, and\ncannot avoid them; but they do not explain intentionality. \nAbelard draws the conclusion that intentionality is a primitive and\nirreducible feature of the mind, our acts of attending to things.\nDifferent acts of attention are intrinsically different from one\nanother; they are about what they are about in virtue of being the\nkind of attention they are. Hence Abelard adopts what is nowadays\ncalled an adverbial theory of thought. \nGiven that intentionality is primitive, Abelard adopts a contextual\napproach to mental content: he embeds these irreducible acts of\nattention in a structure whose articulation helps define the character\nof its constituent elements. The structure Abelard offers is\nlinguistic, a logic of mental acts: just as words can be said to\nexpress thoughts, so too we can use the articulated logic of language\nto give a theory of understanding. In short, Abelard gives something\nvery like a linguistic account of mental representation or\nintentionality. To this end he embraces a principle of\ncompositionality, holding that what an understanding is about is a\nfunction of what its constituent understandings are about. The unity\nof the understanding of a complex is a function of its logical\nsimplicity, which is characterized by the presence of what Abelard\ncalls \u201ca single dominant conjunction\u201d (the logical\noperator of greatest scope). Hence the understanding of a complex may\nbe treated as a complex of distinct understandings, aggregated in the\nsame thought, with its (logical) structure flowing from the\n\u2018dominant conjunction\u2019 over the other logical operations\ngoverning its constituent understandings. Abelard\u2019s acts of\nattention thus display the logical structure of the understanding they\nexpress, and thereby give the semantics of written or spoken language.\nMuch of Abelard\u2019s writings on logic and dialectic are given over\nto working out the details as a scheme for explicating mental\ncontent."},"2":{"chunk_id":"13f30d8a08d2c901a493960c64a20c5b","article_title":"Abhidharma","section_path":["5.

For the orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, the existence of\ndharmas as real entities (dravyatas) is determined\nby both their intrinsic nature and particular causal functioning.\nIntrinsic nature, however, is an atemporal determinant of real\nexistence. What determines a dharma\u2019s spatio-temporal\nexistence is its distinctive causal functioning: past and future\ndharmas have capability (s\u0101marthya) of\nfunctioning, while present dharmas also exert a distinctive\nactivity (k\u0101ritra). Present activity is an internal\ncausal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a\ndharma\u2019s own consciousness series. It is this activity\nthat determines a dharma\u2019s present existence and\ndefines the limits of the span of its present moment.

A\ndharma\u2019s present activity arises and falls away, but\npast and future dharmas all have potential for causal\nfunctioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature.\nFor the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, this model\u2014which insists on\nconstant change within the limits of the present moment and implies\nthe existence of dharmas in the three time\nperiods\u2014preserves both the principle of impermanence yet\nexplains continuity and causal efficacy."},"3":null,"4":null},"39":{"0":null,"1":{"chunk_id":"d4a8c71e9c202dcd232783970bd550ed","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["5.

The mature\nAbhidharma thus assimilates the analysis of\nphenomena-in-time-as-constituted-by-consciousness with a highly\ncomplex description of the consciousness process, dissolving the\ncausal relations between ordered successions of consciousness moments\ninto the activity of perception. As previously noted in section 2, for\nthe Abhidharma, as in Buddhist epistemology in general, sensory\nperception is the paradigm of perceptual, sentient experience. Like\nevery instance of consciousness, sensory perception is intentional,\nencapsulated in the interaction among the sense faculties, their\ncorresponding types of discriminative consciousness, and their\nappropriate sense objects. Different Buddhist schools, however, held\ndifferent positions on the distinctive nature of perceptual\nexperience, and on the specific roles of the sense faculties and\nstatus of sense objects in it. The Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma and the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika both espouse a view that\nproposes a direct contact between perceptual consciousness and its\nsense objects, the latter being understood as sensibilia, for\nwhat we perceive are not objects of common sense but their sensible\nqualities. We may characterize this view as phenomenalist realism\n(Dreyfus 1997, 331 & 336). \nThe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma sets out its theory of the consciousness\nprocess (citta-v\u012bthi) in its commentaries and manuals,\nmainly in the works of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta (5th century CE), and\nAnuruddha (10th or 11th century CE), based on earlier descriptions in\nthe Dhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Vism XIV 111\u2013124,\nXVII 126\u2013145; Dhs-a 82\u2013106 & 267\u2013287;\nVibh-a 155\u2013160; Abhidh-s 17\u201321). The\ntheory is not separate from the dhamma taxonomy and the\nanalysis of citta as previously outlined in section 2.\nRather, in congruency with the notion of existence (whether categorial\nor ontological) as functioning, it analyzes sensory perception as\nresulting from particular functions that are performed by the\neighty-nine citta types revealed by the foregoing taxonomy.\nAccording to this analysis, the specific functions in the\nconsciousness flow occur at particular instants of that continuum, as\nthe normal flow of consciousness involves the mind picking up and\nputting down sense objects by means of successive sets of associated\nmental factors. The result is a fairly static account of mental and\nmaterial phenomena as they arise in consciousness over a series of\nconsciousness\n moments.[16] \nRestricting the account to the consciousness process of ordinary\nbeings, two types of process are described: five-sense-door processes\n(pa\u00f1cadv\u0101ra) and mind-door processes\n(manodv\u0101ra). These may occur in succession, or mind-door\nprocesses may occur independently. Five-sense-door processes account\nfor sensory perception as information is directly received from the\nfields of the five physical sense faculties. Mind-door processes\ninternalize the information received through the sense faculties and\ncharacterize the mind that is absorbed in thought or memory. Objects\nat the \u201cdoor\u201d of the mind, which is treated in Buddhist\nthought as a sixth sense faculty, may be past, present, or future,\npurely conceptual or even transcendent. Normally, however, the object\nat the mind door will be either a past memory or a concept. If there\nis no perceptual activity, as is the case in deep, dreamless sleep,\nthe mind is in a state of rest called inactive mode\n(bhava\u1e45ga). Throughout one\u2019s life, the same type\nof citta performs this function of the inactive mind that is\nthe natural mode to which the mind reverts. The mind switches from its\ninactive mode to a simple mind-door process when a concept or memory\noccurs and no attention is directed to the other five sense fields.\nThe simplest mind-door process is a succession of the following\nfunctions: 1) adverting to the object of thought: a function that\nlasts one moment and becomes internalized as an object support; 2)\nimpulsion: occurs for up to seven moments and performs the function of\nthe mind\u2019s responding actively to the object with wholesome or\nunwholesome karma; 3) retaining: holding on to the object of the\nconsciousness process for one or two moments. \nThe mind switches from its inactive mode to any of the five-sense-door\nprocesses when an object occurs at the \u201cdoor\u201d of the\nappropriate sense faculty. This process of sensory perception involves\na greater number of functions: 1) disturbed inactive mind: a function\nthat arises due to the stimulus of the sense object. It lasts for two\nmoments, during which sensory contact takes place, i.e., a physical\nimpact of the sense object on the physical matter of the appropriate\nsense faculty; 2) adverting: lasts one moment, during which the mind\nturns towards the object at the appropriate sense \u201cdoor;\u201d\n3) perceiving: lasts one moment and is the sheer perception of the\nsense object with minimal interpretation; 4) receiving: lasts one\nmoment and performs the intermediary role of enabling transit to and\nfrom the appropriate discriminative consciousness, whether visual,\nauditory, etc.; 5) investigating: lasts one moment and performs the\nrole of establishing the nature of the sense object and of determining\nthe mind\u2019s response to that object that has just been\nidentified; 6) impulsion: same as in the mind-door process; 7)\nretaining: same as in the mind-door process. As an example, visual\nperception involves not only seeing itself, but also a succession of\nmoments of fixing of the visual object in the mind, recognition of its\ngeneral features, and identification of its nature. In both the\nmind-door and five-sense door processes, the sense faculty and its\nsense object condition the arising of a present moment of a\ncorresponding apprehending consciousness, that is, perception here is\nmodeled on simultaneous conditioning. And in both the mind-door and\nfive-sense door processes, when the retaining function ceases, the\nmind reenters its inactive mode. \nThe consciousness types that perform most of the functions that make\nup the mind-door and the five-sense-door processes fall into the\ncategory of resultant cittas, that is, those that are the\nresult of past actively wholesome or unwholesome consciousness. This\nmeans that the experience of the sense data presented to one\u2019s\nmind is determined by one\u2019s previous actions and is beyond of\none\u2019s immediate control. Whenever one remembers or\nconceptualizes, sees, hears, smells, tastes, or touches something that\nis desirable or pleasing, one experiences a result of previous\nwholesome consciousness. And vice versa with objects that are\nundesirable or unpleasing and previous unwholesome consciousness\nrespectively. Only in the final stage of the consciousness process,\nwhen the mind has chosen to respond actively to its object in some\nway, actively present wholesome or unwholesome consciousness operates\nand constitutes karma that will bear future results. The Abhidhamma\nthus \u201cprovides an exact small-scale analysis of the process of\ndependent arising\u201d (Gethin 1998, 216). \nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika proposes a similar\naccount of sensory perception, but argues that the sensory object\nexists as a real entity. The Sautr\u0101ntika theory of perception,\nhowever, is rather different. It rests on the Sautr\u0101ntika radical\nview of momentariness, according to which there is no real duration\nbut only a succession of infinitesimal moments, and on its view of\ncausation, according to which causes cease to exist when their effects\ncome into existence. The application of these principles to sensory\nperception makes it difficult to explain how perception directly\napprehends sense objects, for it implies that objects have ceased when\ntheir apprehending consciousness arises. The Sautr\u0101ntika reply is\nthat consciousness does not have direct access to its sense objects.\nBy contrast to phenomenalist realism, the Sautr\u0101ntika view of\nperceptual consciousness may be characterized as representationalism:\nit sees perception as apprehending its objects indirectly, through the\nmediation of aspects (\u0101k\u0101ra) representative of\ntheir objects (Dreyfus 1997, 335 & 380\u2013381). \nWhat is common to all the three main Abhidharma\ntraditions\u2014Therav\u0101da, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, and\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2014is that they manifest a somewhat similar\nparadigm shift towards reducing the phenomenal, causally conditioned\nworld into the activity of cognition and consciousness. This shift was\npart of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain,\nand Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical\nquestions about the nature of the external world and the self, and\nfocused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language.\nTheir purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and\nmeans of valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this\nepistemological turn saw the rise of thinkers such as Asa\u1e45ga and\nVasubandhu, the founders of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (400\u2013480 CE),\nand, most notably, Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti (around 500 CE)\nwho developed sophisticated logical and philosophical systems\n(ibid, 15\u201319). The Abhidharma, then, sets the stage for\nthis epistemological turn. The new emphasis becomes dominant from the\nperiod of the vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward and is\nevident in a shift in the terminology used by the Abhidharma to\ndescribe the nature of dharmas. This terminological shift is\nindicated by the terms \u201cparticular inherent\ncharacteristic\u201d (Skt., svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\nsalakkha\u1e47a) and \u201cgeneral characteristic\u201d\n(Skt., s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\ns\u0101m\u0101nyalakkha\u1e47a). \nThe term lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\/lakkha\u1e47a means a mark, or\na specific characteristic that distinguishes an indicated object from\nothers. The Logicians use this term in the sense of\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of a concept or logical category. The\nAbhidharma applies it to the practice of the discernment of\ndharmas, distinguishing between multiple generic\ncharacteristics a dharma shares with other dharmas\nand (at least) one particular inherent characteristic that defines a\ndharma as that very individual occurrence distinct from any\nother instances of its type. The post-canonical Abhidharma thus\nassimilates the concept of the particular inherent characteristic with\nthat of intrinsic nature. \u201cDhammas,\u201d the\nTherav\u0101din commentarial literature states, \u201care so called\nbecause they bear their particular inherent characteristics\u201d\n(Vibh-a 45; Vibh-m\u1e6d 35; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 79; Vism XV 3), and a particular characteristic \u201cis\nthe intrinsic nature that is not held in common by other\ndhammas\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d II 137). Used in\nconjunction or interchangeably with intrinsic nature, the particular\ninherent characteristic constitutes a dhamma\u2019s unique\ndefinition (Vism VI 19, 35). It is an epistemological and\nlinguistic determinant of a dhamma as a knowable instance\nthat is defined by a distinct verbal description. \nThe Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 of the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika similarly distinguishes\nbetween a dharma\u2019s particular inherent and generic\ncharacteristics and identifies the former with intrinsic nature, thus\ndiscriminating \u201clevels in the apprehension or discernment of\ndharmas that serve to clarify the ambiguity encountered in\nthe application of the term svabh\u0101va to both individual\ndharmas and to categorial groups\u201d (Cox 2004A, 575). The\ndifference between the analytical description of dharmas in\nterms of their intrinsic nature or their characteristics, notes Cox\n(ibid, 576), is that \u201cwhereas intrinsic nature acquires\nits special significance in the context of exegetical categorization,\nthe starting point for the characteristics lies in perspectivistic\ncognition. Ontology is a concern for both systems, but the shift in\nterminology from intrinsic nature to the characteristics reflects a\nconcurrent shift from a category-based abstract ontology to an\nepistemological ontology that is experientially or cognitively\ndetermined.\u201d This new epistemological emphasis looms in through\na modified definition of existence proposed by the mature\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegesis that sees the causal efficacy\nunderlying all existence as cognitive. Representing this development\nin the history of Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da thought is Sa\u1e45ghabhadra\n(fifth century CE), who states in his\nNy\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra: \u201cto be an object-field that\nproduces cognition (buddhi) is the true characteristic of\nexistence\u201d (ibid). This means that dharmas as\nthe constituents of our experiential world are objectively\nidentifiable through cognition. \nIn sum, the Abhidharma project, as evident by the dharma\ntheory and its supporting doctrines, is, at bottom, epistemologically\noriented. Yet the project also intends to ascertain that every\nconstituent of the experiential world is knowable and nameable, and\nthat the words and concepts used in the discourse that develops around\nthe discernment of these constituents uniquely define their\ncorresponding referents. The dharma analysis therefore paves\nthe way for conceptual realism: a worldview that is based on the\nnotion of truth as consisting in a correspondence between our concepts\nand statements, on the one hand, and the features of an independent,\ndeterminate reality, on the other hand. Conceptual realism does not\nnecessarily have implications for the ontological status of this\nreality as externally existing. But to espouse such a position is to\nmake a significant move away from the earliest Buddhist teaching that\npresents the Buddha\u2019s view of language as\n conventional.[17]"},"3":null,"4":null},"43":{"0":null,"1":{"chunk_id":"569d9c66a4d4f914a3cffdeea31faab7","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["5.

Likewise,\nit cannot offer any ground for taking the epistemic status of the\nagent into account, although most people would admit that ignorance\ncan morally exculpate an agent. Abelard makes the point with the\nfollowing example: imagine the case of fraternal twins, brother and\nsister, who are separated at birth and each kept in complete ignorance\nof even the existence of the other; as adults they meet, fall in love,\nare legally married and have sexual intercourse. Technically this is\nincest, but Abelard finds no fault in either to lay blame. \nAbelard concludes that in themselves deeds are morally indifferent.\nThe proper subject of moral evaluation is the agent, via his or her\nintentions. It might be objected that the performance or\nnonperformance of the deed could affect the agent\u2019s feelings,\nwhich in turn may affect his or her intentions, so that deeds thereby\nhave moral relevance (at least indirectly). Abelard denies it: \nFor example, if someone forces a monk to lie bound in chains between\ntwo women, and by the softness of the bed and the touch of the women\nbeside him he is brought to pleasure (but not to consent), who may\npresume to call this pleasure, which nature makes necessary, a fault?\n \nWe are so constructed that the feeling of pleasure is inevitable in\ncertain situations: sexual intercourse, eating delicious food, and the\nlike. If sexual pleasure in marriage is not sinful, then the pleasure\nitself, inside or outside of marriage, is not sinful; if it is sinful,\nthen marriage cannot sanctify it\u2014and if the conclusion were\ndrawn that such acts should be performed wholly without pleasure, then\nAbelard declares they cannot be done at all, and it was unreasonable\n(of God) to permit them only in a way in which they cannot be\nperformed. \nOn the positive side, Abelard argues that unless intentions are the\nkey ingredient in assessing moral value it is hard to see why\ncoercion, in which one is forced to do something against his or her\nwill, should exculpate the agent; likewise for ignorance\u2014though\nAbelard points out that the important moral notion is not simply\nignorance but strictly speaking negligence. Abelard takes an extreme\ncase to make his point. He argues that the crucifiers of Christ were\nnot evil in crucifying Jesus. (This example, and others like it, got\nAbelard into trouble with the authorities, and it isn\u2019t hard to\nsee why.) Their ignorance of Christ\u2019s divine nature didn\u2019t\nby itself make them evil; neither did their acting on their (false and\nmistaken) beliefs, in crucifying Christ. Their non-negligent ignorance\nremoves blame from their actions. Indeed, Abelard argues that they\nwould have sinned had they thought crucifying Christ was required and\ndid not crucify Christ: regardless of the facts of the case,\nfailing to abide by one\u2019s conscience in moral action renders the\nagent blameworthy. \nThere are two obvious objections to Abelard\u2019s intentionalism.\nFirst, how is it possible to commit evil voluntarily? Second, since\nintentions are not accessible to anyone other than the agent,\ndoesn\u2019t Abelard\u2019s view entail that it is impossible to\nmake ethical judgements? \nWith regard to the first objection, Abelard has a twofold answer.\nFirst, it is clear that we often want to perform the deed and at the\nsame time do not want to suffer the punishment. A man wants to have\nsexual intercourse with a woman, but not to commit adultery; he would\nprefer it if she were unmarried. Second, it is clear that we sometimes\n\u201cwant what we by no means want to want\u201d: our bodies react\nwith pleasure and desire independently of our wills. If we act on such\ndesires, then our action is done \u201cof\u201d will, as Abelard\ncalls it, though not voluntarily. There is nothing evil in desire:\nthere is only evil in acting on desire, and this is compatible with\nhaving contrary desires. \nWith regard to the second objection, Abelard grants that other humans\ncannot know the agent\u2019s intentions\u2014God, of course, does\nhave access to internal mental states, and so there can be a Final\nJudgement. However, Abelard does not take ethical judgement to pose a\nproblem. God is the only one with a right to pass judgement. Yet this\nfact doesn\u2019t prevent us from enforcing canons of human justice,\nbecause, Abelard holds, human justice has primarily an exemplary and\ndeterrent function. In fact, Abelard argues, it can even be just to\npunish an agent we strongly believe had no evil intention. He cites\ntwo cases. First, a woman accidentally smothers her baby while trying\nto keep it warm at night, and is overcome with grief. Abelard\nmaintains that we should punish her for the beneficial example her\npunishment may have on others: it may make other poor mothers more\ncareful not to accidentally smother their babies while trying to keep\nthem warm. Second, a judge may have excellent (but legally\nimpermissible) evidence that a witness is perjuring himself; since he\ncannot show that the witness is lying, the judge is forced to rule on\nthe basis of the witness\u2019s testimony that the accused, whom he\nbelieves to be innocent, is guilty. Human justice may with propriety\nignore questions of intention. Since there is divine justice, ethical\nnotions are not an idle wheel\u2014nor should they be, even on\nAbelard\u2019s understanding of human justice, since they are the\nmeans by which we determine which intentions to promote or discourage\nwhen we punish people as examples or in order to deter others. \nThere is a sense, then, in which the only certifiable sin is acting\nagainst one\u2019s conscience, unless one is morally negligent. Yet\nif we cannot look to the intrinsic value of the deeds or their\nconsequences, how do we determine which acts are permissible or\nobligatory? Unless conscience has a reliable guide, Abelard\u2019s\nposition seems to open the floodgates to well-meaning\nsubjectivism. \nAbelard solves the problem by taking obedience to God\u2019s\nwill\u2014the hallmark of morally correct behaviour, and itself an\ninstance of natural law\u2014to be a matter of the agent\u2019s\nintention conforming to a purely formal criterion, namely the Golden\nRule (\u201cDo to others as you would be done to\u201d). This\ncriterion can be discovered by reason alone, without any special\nrevelation or religious belief, and is sufficient to ensure the\nrightness of the agent\u2019s intention. But the resolution of this\nproblem immediately leads to another problem. Even if we grant Abelard\nhis naturalistic ethics, why should an agent care if his or her\nintentions conform to the Golden Rule? In short, even if Abelard were\nright about morality, why be moral? \nAbelard\u2019s answer is that our happiness\u2014to which no one is\nindifferent\u2014is linked to virtue, that is, to habitual morally\ncorrect behaviour. Indeed, Abelard\u2019s project in the\nCollationes is to argue that reason can prove that a merely\nnaturalistic ethics is insufficient, and that an agent\u2019s\nhappiness is necessarily bound up with accepting the principles of\ntraditional Christian belief, including the belief in God and an\nAfterlife. In particular, he argues that the Afterlife is a condition\nto which we ought to aspire, that it is a moral improvement even on\nthe life of virtue in this world, and that recognizing this is\nconstitutive of wanting to do what God wants, that is, to live\naccording to the Golden Rule, which guarantees as much as anything can\n(pending divine grace) our long-term postmortem happiness. \nThe Philosopher first argues with the Jew, who espouses a\n\u2018strict observance\u2019 moral theory, namely obedience to the\nMosaic Law. One of the arguments the Jew offers is the Slave\u2019s\nWager (apparently the earliest-known version of Pascal\u2019s Wager).\nImagine that a Slave is told one morning by someone he doesn\u2019t\nknow whether to trust that his powerful and irritable Master, who is\naway for the day, has left instructions about what to do in his\nabsence. The Slave can follow the instructions or not. He reasons that\nif the Master indeed left the instructions, then by following them he\nwill be rewarded and by not following them he will be severely\npunished, whereas if the Master did not leave the instructions he\nwould not be punished for following them, though he might be lightly\npunished for not following them. (This conforms to the standard payoff\nmatrix for Pascal\u2019s Wager.) That is the position the Jew finds\nhimself in: God has apparently demanded unconditional obedience to the\nMosaic Law, the instructions left behind. The Philosopher argues that\nthe Jew may have other choices of action and, in any event, that there\nare rational grounds for thinking that ethics is not a matter of\naction in conformity to law but a matter of the agent\u2019s\nintentions, as we have seen above. \nThe Philosopher then argues with the Christian. He initially maintains\nthat virtue entails happiness, and hence there is no need of an\nAfterlife since a virtuous person remains in the same condition\nwhether dead or alive. The Christian, however, reasons that the\nAfterlife is better, since in addition to the benefits conferred by\nliving virtuously, the agent\u2019s will is no longer impeded by\ncircumstances. In the Afterlife we are no longer subject to the body,\nfor instance, and hence are not bound by physical necessities such as\nfood, shelter, clothing, and the like. The agent can therefore be as\npurely happy as life in accordance with virtue could permit, when no\nexternal circumstances could affect the agent\u2019s actions. The\nPhilosopher grants that the Afterlife so understood is a clear\nimprovement even on the virtuous life in this world, and joins with\nthe Christian in a cooperative endeavour to define the nature of the\nvirtues and the Supreme Good. Virtue is its own reward, and in the\nAfterlife nothing prevents us from rewarding ourselves with virtue to\nthe fullest extent possible."},"2":{"chunk_id":"f8685007f8be5a74cabb1fcf88ec87da","article_title":"Abhidharma","section_path":["6.

That he gave reasoning a role at all brought him into conflict\nwith those we might now call anti-dialecticians, including\nhis fellow abbot Bernard of Clairvaux. That the role he gave it is\nlimited brought him into conflict with those he called\n\u201cpseudo-dialecticians,\u201d including his former teacher\nRoscelin. \nBernard of Clairvaux and other anti-dialecticians seem to have thought\nthat the meaning of a proposition of the faith, to the extent that it\ncan be grasped, is plain; beyond that plain meaning, there is nothing\nwe can grasp at all, in which case reason is clearly no help. That is,\nthe anti-dialecticians were semantic realists about the plain\nmeaning of religious sentences. Hence their impatience with Abelard,\nwho seemed not only bent on obfuscating the plain meaning of\npropositions of the faith, which is bad enough, but to do so by\nreasoning, which has no place either in grasping the plain meaning\n(since the very plainness of plain meaning consists in its being\ngrasped immediately without reasoning) or in reaching some more\nprofound understanding (since only the plain meaning is open to us at\nall). \nAbelard has no patience for the semantic realism that underlies the\nsophisticated anti-dialectical position. Rather than argue against it\nexplicitly, he tries to undermine it. From his commentaries on\nscripture and dogma to his works of speculative theology, Abelard is\nfirst and foremost concerned to show how religious claims can be\nunderstood, and in particular how the application of dialectical\nmethods can clarify and illuminate propositions of the faith.\nFurthermore, he rejects the claim that there is a plain meaning to be\ngrasped. Outlining his method in the Prologue to his Sic et\nnon, Abelard describes how he initially raises a question, e.g.\nwhether priests are required to be celibate, and then arranges\ncitations from scriptural and patristic authorities that at least seem\nto answer the question directly into positive and negative responses.\n(Abelard offers advice in the Prologue for resolving the apparent\ncontradictions among the authorities using a variety of techniques:\nsee whether the words are used in the same sense on both sides; draw\nrelevant distinctions to resolve the issue; look at the context of the\ncitation; make sure that an author is speaking in his own voice rather\nthan merely reporting or paraphrasing someone else\u2019s position;\nand so on.) Now each authority Abelard cites seems to speak clearly\nand unambiguously either for a positive answer to a given question or\nfor a negative one. If ever there were cases of plain meaning, Abelard\nseems to have found them in authorities, on opposing sides of\ncontroversial issues. His advice in the Prologue amounts to saying\nthat sentences that seem to be perfect exemplars of plain meaning in\nfact have to be carefully scrutinized to see just what their meaning\nis. Yet that is just to say that they do not have plain meaning at\nall; we have to use reason to uncover their meaning. Hence the\nanti-dialecticians don\u2019t have a case. \nThere is a far more serious threat to the proper use of reason in\nreligion, Abelard thinks (Theologia christiana 3.20): \nThose who claim to be dialecticians are usually led more easily to\n[heresy] the more they hold themselves to be well-equipped with\nreasons, and, to that extent more secure, they presume to attack or\ndefend any position the more freely. Their arrogance is so great that\nthey think there isn\u2019t anything that can\u2019t be understood\nand explained by their petty little lines of reasoning. Holding all\nauthorities in contempt, they glory in believing only\nthemselves\u2014for those who accept only what their reason persuades\nthem of, surely answer to themselves alone, as if they had eyes that\nwere unacquainted with darkness.\n \nSuch pseudo-dialecticians take reason to be the final arbiter of all\nclaims, including claims about matters of faith. More exactly, Abelard\ncharges them with holding that (a) everything can be explained by\nhuman reason; (b) we should only accept what reason persuades us of;\n(c) appeals to authority have no rational persuasive force. Real\ndialecticians, he maintains, reject (a)\u2013(c), recognizing that\nhuman reason has limits, and that some important truths may lie\noutside those limits but not beyond belief; which claims about matters\nof faith we should accept depends on both the epistemic reliability of\ntheir sources (the authorities) and their consonance with reason to\nthe extent they can be investigated. \nAbelard\u2019s arguments for rejecting (a)\u2013(c) are\nsophisticated and subtle. For the claim that reason may be fruitfully\napplied to a particular article of faith, Abelard offers a particular\ncase study in his own writings. The bulk of Abelard\u2019s work on\ntheology is devoted to his dialectical investigation of the Trinity.\nHe elaborates an original theory of identity to address issues\nsurrounding the Trinity, one that has wider applicability in\nmetaphysics. The upshot of his enquiries is that belief in the Trinity\nis rationally justifiable since as far as reason can take us we find\nthat the doctrine makes sense\u2014at least, once the tools of\ndialectic have been properly employed. \nThe traditional account of identity, derived from Boethius, holds that\nthings may be either generically, specifically, or numerically the\nsame or different. Abelard accepts this account but finds it not\nsufficiently fine-grained to deal with the Trinity. The core of his\ntheory of identity, as presented in his Theologia christiana,\nconsists in four additional modes of identity: (1) essential sameness\nand difference; (2) numerical sameness and difference, which Abelard\nties closely to essential sameness and difference, allowing a more\nfine-grained distinction than Boethius could allow; (3) sameness and\ndifference in definition; (4) sameness and difference in property\n(in proprietate). Roughly, Abelard\u2019s account of\nessential and numerical sameness is intended to improve upon the\nidentity-conditions for things in the world given by the traditional\naccount; his account of sameness in definition is meant to supply\nidentity-conditions for the features of things; and his account of\nsameness in property opens up the possibility of there being different\nidentity-conditions for a single thing having several distinct\nfeatures. \nAbelard holds that two things are the same in essence when\nthey are numerically the same concrete thing (essentia), and\nessentially different otherwise. The Morning Star is essentially the\nsame as the Evening Star, for instance, since each is the selfsame\nplanet Venus. Again, the formal elements that constitute a concrete\nthing are essentially the same as one another and essentially the same\nas the concrete thing of which they are the formal constituents:\nSocrates is his essence (Socrates is what it is to be Socrates). The\ncorresponding general thesis does not hold for parts, however. Abelard\nmaintains that the part is essentially different from the integral\nwhole of which it is a part, reasoning that a given part is completely\ncontained, along with other parts, in the whole, and so is less than\nthe quantity of the whole. \nNumerical difference does not map precisely onto essential difference.\nThe failure of numerical sameness may be due to one of two causes.\nFirst, objects are not numerically the same when one has a part that\nthe other does not have, in which case the objects are essentially\ndifferent as well. Second, objects are numerically different when\nneither has a part belonging to the other. Numerical difference thus\nentails the failure of numerical sameness, but not conversely: a part\nis not numerically the same as its whole, but it is not numerically\ndifferent from its whole. Thus one thing is essentially different from\nanother when either they have only a part in common, in which case\nthey are not numerically the same; or they have no parts in common, in\nwhich case they are numerically different as well as not numerically\nthe same. Since things may be neither numerically the same nor\nnumerically different, the question \u201cHow many things are\nthere?\u201d is ill-formed as it stands and must be made more\nprecise, a fact Abelard exploits in his discussion of the Trinity. \nEssential and numerical sameness and difference apply directly to\nthings in the world; they are extensional forms of identity. By\ncontrast, sameness and difference in definition is roughly analogous\nto modern theories of the identity of properties. Abelard holds that\nthings are the same in definition when what it is to be one\nrequires that it be the other, and conversely; otherwise they differ\nin definition. \nFinally, things are the same in property when they specify\nfeatures that characterize one another. Abelard offers an example to\nclarify this notion. A cube of marble exemplifies both whiteness and\nhardness; what is white is essentially the same as what is hard, since\nthey are numerically the same concrete thing, namely the marble cube;\nyet the whiteness and the hardness in the marble cube clearly differ\nin definition\u2014but even so, what is white is characterized by\nhardness (the white thing is hard), and conversely what is hard is\ncharacterized by whiteness (the hard thing is white). The properties\nof whiteness and hardness are \u201cmixed\u201d since, despite their\nbeing different in definition, each applies to the selfsame concrete\nthing (namely the marble cube) as such and also as it is characterized\nby the other. \nThe interesting case is where something has properties that\n\u201cremain so completely unmixed\u201d that the items they\ncharacterize are different in property. Consider a\nform-matter composite in relation to its matter. The matter out of\nwhich a form-matter composite is made is essentially the same as the\ncomposite, since each is the entire material composite itself. Yet\ndespite their essential sameness, they are not identical; the matter\nis not the composite, nor conversely. The matter is not the composite,\nfor the composite comes to be out of the matter, but the matter does\nnot come to be out of itself. The composite is not the matter, since\n\u201cnothing is in any way a constitutive part of or naturally prior\nto itself.\u201d Instead, the matter is prior to the composite since\nit has the property priority with respect to the composite,\nwhereas the composite is posterior to its matter since it has the\nproperty posteriority with respect to its matter. Now despite\nbeing essentially the same, the matter is not characterized by\nposteriority, unlike the composite, and the composite is not\ncharacterized by priority, unlike the matter. Hence the matter and\ncomposite are different in property; the properties priority\nand posteriority are unmixed\u2014they differ in\nproperty. \nNow for the payoff. Abelard deploys his theory of identity to shed\nlight on the Trinity as follows. The three Persons are essentially the\nsame as one another, since they are all the same concrete thing\n(namely God). They differ from one another in definition, since what\nit is to be the Father is not the same as what it is to be the Son or\nwhat it is to be the Holy Spirit. The three Persons are numerically\ndifferent from one another, for otherwise they would not be three, but\nthey are not numerically different from God: if they were there would\nbe three gods, not one. Moreover, each Person has properties that\nuniquely apply to it\u2014unbegotten to the Father,\nbegotten to the Son, and proceeding to the Holy\nSpirit\u2014as well as properties that are distinctive of it, such as\npower for the Father, wisdom for the Son, and\ngoodness for the Holy Spirit. The unique properties are\nunmixed in Abelard\u2019s technical sense, for the Persons differ\nfrom one another in their unique properties, and such properties do\nnot apply to God; the distinctive properties are mixed, though, in\nthat God is characterized by each (the powerful God is the wise God is\nthe good God). Further than that, Abelard holds, human reason cannot\ngo; but reason validates the analysis (strictly speaking only a\n\u201clikeness\u201d or analogy) as far as it can go."},"2":null,"3":null,"4":null},"62":{"0":null,"1":{"chunk_id":"233c246f27e08771ec7a240aca84a11f","article_title":"Peter Abelard","section_path":["7.

Outlining his method in the Prologue to his Sic et\nnon, Abelard describes how he initially raises a question, e.g.\nwhether priests are required to be celibate, and then arranges\ncitations from scriptural and patristic authorities that at least seem\nto answer the question directly into positive and negative responses.\n(Abelard offers advice in the Prologue for resolving the apparent\ncontradictions among the authorities using a variety of techniques:\nsee whether the words are used in the same sense on both sides; draw\nrelevant distinctions to resolve the issue; look at the context of the\ncitation; make sure that an author is speaking in his own voice rather\nthan merely reporting or paraphrasing someone else\u2019s position;\nand so on.) Now each authority Abelard cites seems to speak clearly\nand unambiguously either for a positive answer to a given question or\nfor a negative one. If ever there were cases of plain meaning, Abelard\nseems to have found them in authorities, on opposing sides of\ncontroversial issues. His advice in the Prologue amounts to saying\nthat sentences that seem to be perfect exemplars of plain meaning in\nfact have to be carefully scrutinized to see just what their meaning\nis. Yet that is just to say that they do not have plain meaning at\nall; we have to use reason to uncover their meaning.
