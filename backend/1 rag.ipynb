       "   'content': '\\nThe type of inference exemplified in the cases described at the\\nbeginning of this entry will strike most as entirely familiar.\\nPhilosophers as well as psychologists tend to agree that abduction is\\nfrequently employed in everyday reasoning. Sometimes our reliance on\\nabductive reasoning is quite obvious and explicit. But in some daily\\npractices, it may be so routine and automatic that it easily goes\\nunnoticed. A case in point may be our trust in other people’s\\ntestimony, which has been said to rest on abductive reasoning; see\\nHarman 1965, Adler 1994, Fricker 1994, and Lipton 1998 for defenses of\\nthis claim. For instance, according to Jonathan Adler (1994, 274f),\\n“[t]he best explanation for why the informant asserts that\\nP is normally that … he believes it for duly responsible\\nreasons and … he intends that I shall believe it too,”\\nwhich is why we are normally justified in trusting the\\ninformant’s testimony. This may well be correct, even though in\\ncoming to trust a person’s testimony one does not normally seem\\nto be aware of any abductive reasoning going on in one’s mind.\\nSimilar remarks may apply to what some hold to be a further, possibly\\neven more fundamental, role of abduction in linguistic practice, to\\nwit, its role in determining what a speaker means by an utterance.\\nSpecifically, it has been argued that decoding utterances is a matter\\nof inferring the best explanation of why someone said what he or she\\nsaid in the context in which the utterance was made. Even more\\nspecifically, authors working in the field of pragmatics have\\nsuggested that hearers invoke the Gricean maxims of conversation to\\nhelp them work out the best explanation of a speaker’s utterance\\nwhenever the semantic content of the utterance is insufficiently\\ninformative for the purposes of the conversation, or is too\\ninformative, or off-topic, or implausible, or otherwise odd or\\ninappropriate; see, for instance, Bach and Harnish 1979 (92f), Dascal\\n1979 (167), and Hobbs 2004. As in cases of reliance on speaker\\ntestimony, the requisite abductive reasoning would normally seem to\\ntake place at a subconscious level. \\nAbductive reasoning is not limited to everyday contexts. Quite the\\ncontrary: philosophers of science have argued that abduction is a\\ncornerstone of scientific methodology; see, for instance, Boyd 1981,\\n1984, Harré 1986, 1988, Lipton 1991, 2004, and Psillos 1999.\\nAccording to Timothy Williamson (2007), “[t]he abductive\\nmethodology is the best science provides” and Ernan McMullin\\n(1992) even goes so far to call abduction “the inference that\\nmakes science.” To illustrate the use of abduction in science,\\nwe consider two examples. \\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was discovered that the\\norbit of Uranus, one of the seven planets known at the time, departed\\nfrom the orbit as predicted on the basis of Isaac Newton’s\\ntheory of universal gravitation and the auxiliary assumption that\\nthere were no further planets in the solar system. One possible\\nexplanation was, of course, that Newton’s theory is false. Given\\nits great empirical successes for (then) more than two centuries, that\\ndid not appear to be a very good explanation. Two astronomers, John\\nCouch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, instead suggested (independently of\\neach other but almost simultaneously) that there was an eighth, as yet\\nundiscovered planet in the solar system; that, they thought, provided\\nthe best explanation of Uranus’ deviating orbit. Not much later,\\nthis planet, which is now known as “Neptune,” was\\ndiscovered. \\nThe second example concerns what is now commonly regarded to have been\\nthe discovery of the electron by the English physicist Joseph John\\nThomson. Thomson had conducted experiments on cathode rays in order to\\ndetermine whether they are streams of charged particles. He concluded\\nthat they are indeed, reasoning as follows: \\n\\n\\nAs the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are\\ndeflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively\\nelectrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in\\nwhich this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving\\nalong the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion\\nthat they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of\\nmatter. (Thomson, cited in Achinstein 2001, 17)\\n \\nThe conclusion that cathode rays consist of negatively charged\\nparticles does not follow logically from the reported experimental\\nresults, nor could Thomson draw on any relevant statistical data. That\\nnevertheless he could “see no escape from the conclusion”\\nis, we may safely assume, because the conclusion is the best—in\\nthis case presumably even the only plausible—explanation of his\\nresults that he could think of. \\nMany other examples of scientific uses of abduction have been\\ndiscussed in the literature; see, for instance, Harré 1986,\\n1988 and Lipton 1991, 2004. Abduction is also said to be the\\npredominant mode of reasoning in medical diagnosis: physicians tend to\\ngo for the hypothesis that best explains the patient’s symptoms\\n(see Josephson and Josephson (eds.) 1994, 9–12; see also\\nDragulinescu 2016 on abductive reasoning in the context of\\nmedicine). \\nLast but not least, abduction plays a central role in some important\\nphilosophical debates. See Shalkowski 2010 on the place of abduction\\nin metaphysics (also Bigelow 2010), Krzyżanowska, Wenmackers, and\\nDouven 2014 and Douven 2016a for a possible role of\\nabduction in the semantics of conditionals, and Williamson\\n2017 for an application of abduction in the philosophy of logic.\\nArguably, however, abduction plays its most notable philosophical role\\nin epistemology and in the philosophy of science, where it is\\nfrequently invoked in objections to so-called underdetermination\\narguments. Underdetermination arguments generally start from the\\npremise that a number of given hypotheses are empirically equivalent,\\nwhich their authors take to mean that the evidence—indeed, any\\nevidence we might ever come to possess—is unable to favor one of\\nthem over the others. From this, we are supposed to conclude that one\\ncan never be warranted in believing any particular one of the\\nhypotheses. (This is rough, but it will do for present purposes; see\\nDouven 2008 and Stanford 2009, for more detailed accounts of\\nunderdetermination arguments.) A famous instance of this type of\\nargument is the Cartesian argument for global skepticism, according to\\nwhich the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we\\ncustomarily deem it to be is empirically equivalent to a variety of\\nso-called skeptical hypotheses (such as that we are beguiled by an\\nevil demon, or that we are brains in a vat, connected to a\\nsupercomputer; see, e.g., Folina 2016). Similar arguments have been\\ngiven in support of scientific antirealism, according to which it will\\nnever be warranted for us to choose between empirically equivalent\\nrivals concerning what underlies the observable part of reality (van\\nFraassen 1980). \\nResponses to these arguments typically point to the fact that the\\nnotion of empirical equivalence at play unduly neglects explanatory\\nconsiderations, for instance, by defining the notion strictly in terms\\nof hypotheses’ making the same predictions. Those responding\\nthen argue that even if some hypotheses make exactly the same\\npredictions, one of them may still be a better explanation of the\\nphenomena predicted. Thus, if explanatory considerations have a role\\nin determining which inferences we are licensed to make—as\\naccording to defenders of abduction they have—then we might\\nstill be warranted in believing in the truth (or probable truth, or\\nsome such, depending—as will be seen below—on the version\\nof abduction one assumes) of one of a number of hypotheses that all\\nmake the same predictions. Following Bertrand Russell (1912, Ch. 2),\\nmany epistemologists have invoked abduction in arguing against\\nCartesian skepticism, their key claim being that even though, by\\nconstruction, the skeptical hypotheses make the same predictions as\\nthe hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we ordinarily take\\nit to be, they are not equally good explanations of what they predict;\\nin particular, the skeptical hypotheses have been said to be\\nconsiderably less simple than the “ordinary world”\\nhypothesis. See, among many others, Harman 1973 (Chs. 8 and 11),\\nGoldman 1988 (205), Moser 1989 (161), and Vogel 1990, 2005; see\\nPargetter 1984 for an abductive response specifically to skepticism\\nregarding other minds. Similarly, philosophers of science have argued\\nthat we are warranted to believe in Special Relativity Theory as\\nopposed to Lorentz’s version of the æther theory. For even\\nthough these theories make the same predictions, the former is\\nexplanatorily superior to the latter. (Most arguments that have been\\ngiven for this claim come down to the contention that Special\\nRelativity Theory is ontologically more parsimonious than its\\ncompetitor, which postulates the existence of an æther. See\\nJanssen 2002 for an excellent discussion of the various reasons\\nphilosophers of science have adduced for preferring Einstein’s\\ntheory to Lorentz’s.)'}},\n",

       "   'content': '\\nWe have already encountered the so-called argument of the bad lot,\\nwhich, we saw, is valid as a criticism of ABD1 but powerless against\\nvarious (what we called) congruous rules of abduction. We here\\nconsider two objections that are meant to be more general. The first\\neven purports to challenge the core idea underlying abduction; the\\nsecond is not quite as general, but it is still meant to undermine a\\nbroad class of candidate explications of abduction. Both objections\\nare due to Bas van Fraassen. \\nThe first objection has as a premise that it is part of the meaning of\\n“explanation” that if one theory is more explanatory than\\nanother, the former must be more informative than the latter (see,\\ne.g., van Fraassen 1983, Sect. 2). The alleged problem then is that it\\nis “an elementary logical point that a more informative theory\\ncannot be more likely to be true [and thus] attempts to describe\\ninductive or evidential support through features that require\\ninformation (such as ‘Inference to the Best Explanation’)\\nmust either contradict themselves or equivocate” (van Fraassen\\n1989, 192). The elementary logical point is supposed to be “most\\n[obvious] … in the paradigm case in which one theory is an\\nextension of another: clearly the extension has more ways of being\\nfalse” (van Fraassen 1985, 280). \\nIt is important to note, however, that in any other kind of case than\\nthe “paradigm” one, the putative elementary point is not\\nobvious at all. For instance, it is entirely unclear in what sense\\nSpecial Relativity Theory “has more ways of being false”\\nthan Lorentz’s version of the æther theory, given that\\nthey make the same predictions. And yet the former is generally\\nregarded as being superior, qua explanation, to the latter.\\n(If van Fraassen were to object that the former is not really more\\ninformative than the latter, or at any rate not more informative in\\nthe appropriate sense—whatever that is—then we should\\ncertainly refuse to grant the premise that in order to be more\\nexplanatory a theory must be more informative.) \\nThe second objection, proffered in van Fraassen 1989 (Ch. 6), is\\nlevelled at probabilistic versions of abduction. The objection is that\\nsuch rules must either amount to Bayes’ rule, and thus be\\nredundant, or be at variance with it but then, on the grounds of\\nLewis’ dynamic Dutch book argument (as reported in Teller 1973),\\nbe probabilistically incoherent, meaning that they may lead one to\\nassess as fair a number of bets which together ensure a financial\\nloss, come what may; and, van Fraassen argues, it would be irrational\\nto follow a rule that has this feature. \\nHowever, this objection fares no better than the first. For one thing,\\nas Patrick Maher (1992) and Brian Skyrms (1993) have pointed out, a\\nloss in one respect may be outweighed by a benefit in another. It\\nmight be, for instance, that some probabilistic version of abduction\\ndoes much better, at least in our world, than Bayes’ rule, in\\nthat, on average, it approaches the truth faster in the sense that it\\nis faster in assigning a high probability (understood as probability\\nabove a certain threshold value) to the true hypothesis (see Douven\\n2013, 2020, and Douven and Wenmackers 2017; see Climenhaga\\n2017 for discussion). If it does, then following that rule\\ninstead of Bayes’ rule may have advantages which perhaps are not\\nso readily expressed in terms of money yet which should arguably be\\ntaken into account when deciding which rule to go by. It is, in short,\\nnot so clear whether following a probabilistically incoherent rule\\nmust be irrational. \\nFor another thing, Douven (1999) argues that the question of whether a\\nprobabilistic rule is coherent is not one that can be settled\\nindependently of considering which other epistemic and\\ndecision-theoretic rules are deployed along with it; coherence should\\nbe understood as a property of packages of both epistemic and\\ndecision-theoretic rules, not of epistemic rules (such as\\nprobabilistic rules for belief change) in isolation. In the same\\npaper, a coherent package of rules is described which includes a\\nprobabilistic version of abduction. (See Kvanvig 1994, Harman 1997,\\nLeplin 1997, Niiniluoto 1999, and Okasha 2000, for different responses\\nto van Fraassen’s critique of probabilistic versions of\\nabduction.)'}},\n",

       "   'content': '\\nHardly anyone nowadays would want to subscribe to a conception of\\ntruth that posits a necessary connection between explanatory force and\\ntruth—for instance, because it stipulates explanatory\\nsuperiority to be necessary for truth. As a result, a priori defenses\\nof abduction seem out of the question. Indeed, all defenses that have\\nbeen given so far are of an empirical nature in that they appeal to\\ndata that supposedly support the claim that (in some form) abduction\\nis a reliable rule of inference. \\nThe best-known argument of this sort was developed by Richard Boyd in\\nthe 1980s (see Boyd 1981, 1984, 1985). It starts by underlining the\\ntheory-dependency of scientific methodology, which comprises methods\\nfor designing experiments, for assessing data, for choosing between\\nrival hypotheses, and so on. For instance, in considering possible\\nconfounding factors from which an experimental setup has to be\\nshielded, scientists draw heavily on already accepted theories. The\\nargument next calls attention to the apparent reliability of this\\nmethodology, which, after all, has yielded, and continues to yield,\\nimpressively accurate theories. In particular, by relying on this\\nmethodology, scientists have for some time now been able to find ever\\nmore instrumentally adequate theories. Boyd then argues that the\\nreliability of scientific methodology is best explained by assuming\\nthat the theories on which it relies are at least approximately true.\\nFrom this and from the fact that these theories were mostly arrived at\\nby abductive reasoning, he concludes that abduction must be a reliable\\nrule of inference. \\nCritics have accused this argument of being circular. Specifically, it\\nhas been said that the argument rests on a premise—that\\nscientific methodology is informed by approximately true background\\ntheories—which in turn rests on an inference to the best\\nexplanation for its plausibility. And the reliability of this type of\\ninference is precisely what is at stake. (See, for instance, Laudan\\n1981 and Fine 1984.) \\nTo this, Stathis Psillos (1999, Ch. 4) has responded by invoking a\\ndistinction credited to Richard Braithwaite, to wit, the distinction\\nbetween premise-circularity and rule-circularity. An argument is\\npremise-circular if its conclusion is amongst its premises. A\\nrule-circular argument, by contrast, is an argument of which the\\nconclusion asserts something about an inferential rule that is used in\\nthe very same argument. As Psillos urges, Boyd’s argument is\\nrule-circular, but not premise-circular, and rule-circular arguments,\\nPsillos contends, need not be viciously circular (even though\\na premise-circular argument is always viciously circular). To be more\\nprecise, in his view, an argument for the reliability of a given rule\\nR that essentially relies on R as an inferential\\nprinciple is not vicious, provided that the use of R does not\\nguarantee a positive conclusion about R’s reliability.\\nPsillos claims that in Boyd’s argument, this proviso is met. For\\nwhile Boyd concludes that the background theories on which scientific\\nmethodology relies are approximately true on the basis of an abductive\\nstep, the use of abduction itself does not guarantee the truth of his\\nconclusion. After all, granting the use of abduction does nothing to\\nensure that the best explanation of the success of scientific\\nmethodology is the approximate truth of the relevant background\\ntheories. Thus, Psillos concludes, Boyd’s argument still\\nstands. \\nEven if the use of abduction in Boyd’s argument might have led\\nto the conclusion that abduction is not reliable, one may\\nstill have worries about the argument’s being rule-circular. For\\nsuppose that some scientific community relied not on abduction but on\\na rule that we may dub “Inference to the Worst\\nExplanation” (IWE), a rule that sanctions inferring to the\\nworst explanation of the available data. We may safely assume\\nthat the use of this rule mostly would lead to the adoption of very\\nunsuccessful theories. Nevertheless, the said community might justify\\nits use of IWE by dint of the following reasoning: “Scientific\\ntheories tend to be hugely unsuccessful. These theories were arrived\\nat by application of IWE. That IWE is a reliable rule of\\ninference—that is, a rule of inference mostly leading from true\\npremises to true conclusions—is surely the worst explanation of\\nthe fact that our theories are so unsuccessful. Hence, by application\\nof IWE, we may conclude that IWE is a reliable rule of\\ninference.” While this would be an utterly absurd conclusion,\\nthe argument leading up to it cannot be convicted of being viciously\\ncircular anymore than Boyd’s argument for the reliability of\\nabduction can (if Psillos is right). It would appear, then, that there\\nmust be something else amiss with rule-circularity. \\nIt is fair to note that for Psillos, the fact that a rule-circular\\nargument does not guarantee a positive conclusion about the rule at\\nissue is not sufficient for such an argument to be valid. A further\\nnecessary condition is “that one should not have reason to doubt\\nthe reliability of the rule—that there is nothing currently\\navailable which can make one distrust the rule” (Psillos 1999,\\n85). And there is plenty of reason to doubt the reliability of IWE; in\\nfact, the above argument supposes that it is unreliable. Two\\nquestions arise, however. First, why should we accept the additional\\ncondition? Second, do we really have no reason to doubt the\\nreliability of abduction? Certainly some of the abductive\\ninferences we make lead us to accept falsehoods. How many\\nfalsehoods may we accept on the basis of abduction before we can\\nlegitimately begin to distrust this rule? No clear answers have been\\ngiven to these questions. \\nBe this as it may, even if rule-circularity is neither vicious nor\\notherwise problematic, one may still wonder how Boyd’s argument\\nis to convert a critic of abduction, given that it relies on\\nabduction. But Psillos makes it clear that the point of philosophical\\nargumentation is not always, and in any case need not be, to convince\\nan opponent of one’s position. Sometimes the point is, more\\nmodestly, to assure or reassure oneself that the position one\\nendorses, or is tempted to endorse, is correct. In the case at hand,\\nwe need not think of Boyd’s argument as an attempt to convince\\nthe opponent of abduction of its reliability. Rather, it may be\\nthought of as justifying the rule from within the perspective of\\nsomeone who is already sympathetic towards abduction; see Psillos 1999\\n(89). \\nThere have also been attempts to argue for abduction in a more\\nstraightforward fashion, to wit, via enumerative induction. The common\\nidea of these attempts is that every newly recorded successful\\napplication of abduction—like the discovery of Neptune, whose\\nexistence had been postulated on explanatory grounds (see Section\\n1.2)—adds further support to the hypothesis that abduction is a\\nreliable rule of inference, in the way in which every newly observed\\nblack raven adds some support to the hypothesis that all ravens are\\nblack. Because it does not involve abductive reasoning, this type of\\nargument is more likely to also appeal to disbelievers in abduction.\\nSee Harré 1986, 1988, Bird 1998 (160), Kitcher 2001, and Douven\\n2002 for suggestions along these lines.'}}]"

      "methodology is the best science provides” and Ernan McMullin\n",
      "(1992) even goes so far to call abduction “the inference that\n",
      "makes science.” To illustrate the use of abduction in science,\n",
      "we consider two examples. \n",
      "At the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was discovered that the\n",
      "orbit of Uranus, one of the seven planets known at the time, departed\n",
      "from the orbit as predicted on the basis of Isaac Newton’s\n",
      "theory of universal gravitation and the auxiliary assumption that\n",
      "there were no further planets in the solar system. One possible\n",
      "explanation was, of course, that Newton’s theory is false. Given\n",
      "its great empirical successes for (then) more than two centuries, that\n",
      "did not appear to be a very good explanation. Two astronomers, John\n",
      "Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier, instead suggested (independently of\n",
      "each other but almost simultaneously) that there was an eighth, as yet\n",
      "undiscovered planet in the solar system; that, they thought, provided\n",
      "the best explanation of Uranus’ deviating orbit. Not much later,\n",
      "this planet, which is now known as “Neptune,” was\n",
      "discovered. \n",
      "The second example concerns what is now commonly regarded to have been\n",
      "the discovery of the electron by the English physicist Joseph John\n",
      "Thomson. Thomson had conducted experiments on cathode rays in order to\n",
      "determine whether they are streams of charged particles. He concluded\n",
      "that they are indeed, reasoning as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are\n",
      "deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively\n",
      "electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in\n",
      "which this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving\n",
      "along the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion\n",
      "that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of\n",
      "matter. (Thomson, cited in Achinstein 2001, 17)\n",
      " \n",
      "The conclusion that cathode rays consist of negatively charged\n",
      "particles does not follow logically from the reported experimental\n",
      "results, nor could Thomson draw on any relevant statistical data. That\n",
      "nevertheless he could “see no escape from the conclusion”\n",
      "is, we may safely assume, because the conclusion is the best—in\n",
      "this case presumably even the only plausible—explanation of his\n",
      "results that he could think of. \n",
      "Many other examples of scientific uses of abduction have been\n",
      "discussed in the literature; see, for instance, Harré 1986,\n",
      "1988 and Lipton 1991, 2004. Abduction is also said to be the\n",
      "predominant mode of reasoning in medical diagnosis: physicians tend to\n",
      "go for the hypothesis that best explains the patient’s symptoms\n",
      "(see Josephson and Josephson (eds.) 1994, 9–12; see also\n",
      "Dragulinescu 2016 on abductive reasoning in the context of\n",
      "medicine). \n",
      "Last but not least, abduction plays a central role in some important\n",
      "philosophical debates. See Shalkowski 2010 on the place of abduction\n",
      "in metaphysics (also Bigelow 2010), Krzyżanowska, Wenmackers, and\n",

      "Arguably, however, abduction plays its most notable philosophical role\n",
      "in epistemology and in the philosophy of science, where it is\n",
      "frequently invoked in objections to so-called underdetermination\n",
      "arguments. Underdetermination arguments generally start from the\n",
      "premise that a number of given hypotheses are empirically equivalent,\n",
      "which their authors take to mean that the evidence—indeed, any\n",
      "evidence we might ever come to possess—is unable to favor one of\n",
      "them over the others. From this, we are supposed to conclude that one\n",
      "can never be warranted in believing any particular one of the\n",
      "hypotheses. (This is rough, but it will do for present purposes; see\n",
      "Douven 2008 and Stanford 2009, for more detailed accounts of\n",
      "underdetermination arguments.) A famous instance of this type of\n",
      "argument is the Cartesian argument for global skepticism, according to\n",
      "which the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we\n",
      "customarily deem it to be is empirically equivalent to a variety of\n",
      "so-called skeptical hypotheses (such as that we are beguiled by an\n",
      "evil demon, or that we are brains in a vat, connected to a\n",
      "supercomputer; see, e.g., Folina 2016). Similar arguments have been\n",

      "rivals concerning what underlies the observable part of reality (van\n",
      "Fraassen 1980). \n",
      "Responses to these arguments typically point to the fact that the\n",
      "notion of empirical equivalence at play unduly neglects explanatory\n",
      "considerations, for instance, by defining the notion strictly in terms\n",
      "of hypotheses’ making the same predictions. Those responding\n",
      "then argue that even if some hypotheses make exactly the same\n",
      "predictions, one of them may still be a better explanation of the\n",
      "phenomena predicted. Thus, if explanatory considerations have a role\n",
      "in determining which inferences we are licensed to make—as\n",
      "according to defenders of abduction they have—then we might\n",
      "still be warranted in believing in the truth (or probable truth, or\n",
      "some such, depending—as will be seen below—on the version\n",
      "of abduction one assumes) of one of a number of hypotheses that all\n",
      "make the same predictions. Following Bertrand Russell (1912, Ch. 2),\n",
      "many epistemologists have invoked abduction in arguing against\n",
      "Cartesian skepticism, their key claim being that even though, by\n",
      "construction, the skeptical hypotheses make the same predictions as\n",
      "the hypothesis that reality is more or less the way we ordinarily take\n",
      "it to be, they are not equally good explanations of what they predict;\n",
      "in particular, the skeptical hypotheses have been said to be\n",
      "considerably less simple than the “ordinary world”\n",
      "hypothesis. See, among many others, Harman 1973 (Chs. 8 and 11),\n",
      "Goldman 1988 (205), Moser 1989 (161), and Vogel 1990, 2005; see\n",
      "Pargetter 1984 for an abductive response specifically to skepticism\n",
      "regarding other minds. Similarly, philosophers of science have argued\n",

      "opposed to Lorentz’s version of the æther theory. For even\n",

      "various (what we called) congruous rules of abduction. We here\n",
      "consider two objections that are meant to be more general. The first\n",
      "even purports to challenge the core idea underlying abduction; the\n",
      "second is not quite as general, but it is still meant to undermine a\n",
      "broad class of candidate explications of abduction. Both objections\n",
      "are due to Bas van Fraassen. \n",
      "The first objection has as a premise that it is part of the meaning of\n",
      "“explanation” that if one theory is more explanatory than\n",
      "another, the former must be more informative than the latter (see,\n",
      "e.g., van Fraassen 1983, Sect. 2). The alleged problem then is that it\n",

       "'In this context, abduction is a type of reasoning that involves drawing an inference from a given set of statements or circumstances to a hypothesis that best explains the phenomenon in question. It is also referred to as \"inference to the best explanation\" or \"abductive reasoning.\"\\n\\nAbduction is a distinct type of reasoning that is different from deduction and induction. Deduction involves drawing a conclusion based on a set of given premises, whereas induction involves drawing a general conclusion from a set of specific instances. Abduction, on the other hand, involves drawing a hypothesis to explain a phenomenon based on the available evidence.\\n\\nThe concept of abduction was first introduced by C.S. Peirce, an American philosopher and logician, in the late 19th century. Peirce defined abduction as \"the process of forming a hypothesis that best explains the available data.\"\\n\\nIn the philosophy of science, abduction is considered an essential component of scientific methodology. Scientists often use abduction to formulate hypotheses that can be tested and verified through experimentation and observation.\\n\\nIn everyday life, abduction is also used in various contexts, such as in medicine, law enforcement, and decision-making. For example, a doctor may use abduction to diagnose a patient\\'s illness based on their symptoms, or a detective may use abduction to identify the perpetrator of a crime.\\n\\nOne of the key features of abduction is that it is not necessarily a logical or deductive process. It involves making an inference from a set of evidence, but the inference may not be guaranteed to be correct. Instead, abduction involves using reasoning and creativity to come up with a plausible explanation for the phenomenon in question.\\n\\nIn this context, philosophers have debated the nature and reliability of abduction. Some argue that abduction is a reliable method of reasoning, while others argue that it is more of a hunch or a guess. The debate surrounding the reliability of abduction is ongoing, and it remains an important topic of discussion in the philosophy of science and epistemology.'"
